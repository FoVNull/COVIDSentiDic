The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book.

I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for "Journey to the West" and "Outlaws of the Marsh".  I tried a different translation for "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well. I prefer the Moss Robert's version because: 1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others) 2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class 3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period. The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads. If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms. FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor. I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well.

This is Moss Roberts's translation of the Mao version of the Chinese classic "Three Kingdoms," a highly-influential historical novel that covers a sweep of over a century from 168 A.D. to 280 A.D., encompassing the fall of the Han dynasty, and the ensuing struggle between the resulting three kingdoms, as signaled by the book's opening sentences: "Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus has it ever been." The authorship of the novel is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong, writing in the fourteenth century, over a millennium after the novel's events. Complicating the novel's history, there were at least two main versions of the narrative: a print edition from 1522 (well after Luo Guanzhong's death), and a subsequent major revision of this dating from the 1660s. The version from the 1660s edited by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang (father and son) is the dominant one, and this is the version that Moss Roberts has translated. The novel is episodic, very lengthy, and has a vast cast of roughly a thousand characters, over a hundred of which Moss Roberts classifies as major characters. The original audience would have been very familiar with the story's heroes, who were the subject of popular stories and plays that predate the book. I, however, was entirely unfamiliar with the characters and the historical period, and would have struggled to make sense of it but for Roberts's extensive and very helpful notes. Even with the notes, I found the book an effort to read. While I cannot exactly say that I enjoyed it, I am glad that I read it. The scale of the story is epic: men scheme and betray each other, factions vie for control of the empire, huge armies -- sometimes of over a hundred thousand soldiers -- battle. The book also reminds me of China's long history of civilization. Despite dynastic struggles, such as those shown in Three Kingdoms, China's organized bureaucracy lasted for millennia, run by highly-educated officials (and helped by the invention of paper). The book raises questions of what makes an ideal ruler, an ideal minister, an ideal general, and includes many instances of ruses and clever schemes. The novel's opening chapter includes the swearing of an oath of brotherhood between three heroes, Liu Bei (known as Xuande), Lord Guan, and Zhang Fei in a peach orchard. The scene is renowned, yet I found it underwhelming, as I likewise found other famous moments in the story underwhelming. The lengthy story never once brought me close to tears; I never came to love its heroes. If I had the stamina to re-read the whole book, perhaps this would change. Knowing what lay ahead, having familiarity with the characters, the events might have more emotional weight for me. On my first reading, I was interested rather than moved. And the initial impact of the novel, for me, was bleak: kingdoms fall and rise, cruel and selfish individuals may prosper, heroes are imperfect, everyone dies, women are largely relegated to the sidelines. A handful more assorted comments.... Firstly, I read this in parallel with Brewitt-Taylor's 1925 translation, and I considerably prefer Moss Roberts's version, both for its prose style and for its invaluable footnotes (plus an illuminating one-hundred-page-long afterword). Secondly, as the afterword clarifies, the book drew heavily on historical records, but amended and added to them, so that one scholar, Zhang Xuecheng, later characterized it as "seven parts fact and three parts fiction." Thirdly, this edition includes occasional illustrations, which I welcomed, though their reproduction quality was sometimes poor. Fourthly, the book contains many fantastical elements: portents and sorcery and ghosts. Fifthly, the book contains a fair amount of poetry.

If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book.

After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself.

I've only looked through the first book at this moment but I saw that names and words are randomly misspelled throughout the whole book. Also the text is slightly off-centered on the page like it's slanted. It's as if someone had placed it on a scanner in a crooked way. I have screenshots of this attached: notice that the Character "Yuan Shao" is spelled as "Yuan Soao" and that the margin gradually widens throughout on the right hand side. I expected higher quality control that this. This is not acceptable.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	A. Steven Toby	4.0	2018年8月4日 在美国审核	2	An Epic Tale of Loyalty and Betrayal	In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire. It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the "Three Kingdoms" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together. For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience. The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map. The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's "just" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history. A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.) Despite these caveats, "Three Kingdoms" is a work worthy of your time.

Story quality is fine, the technical aspects make it hard to read. It only shows one panel at a time, at low resolution. The Kindle PC app doesn't allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like 2" in size. I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround. Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesn't help much either.

It has 120 chapters or 2339 pages, the only unabridged version translated by a native English speaker who has been furiously studying Chinese history and language. (I had purchased the ebook version and was disappointed to find those to be incomplete.) I bought them as a gift for my bookworm hubby, since he was hoping to get into some Chinese classics. This book set has helpful footnotes providing enough contexts and also figured and maps. We compared this translation with the more recent one translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Iverson. Together we concluded that Moss Roberts translation is more elegant.

Unfortunately I cannot read Chinese at all so I had to rely on finding a translated version. I came across and attempted a Brewitt-Taylor translation a while back but could not finish the book through that version.  The names of all the people and the way it read did not quite flow as nicely for me.  This version by Robert Moss is fantastic. It reads nicely and is full of notes and annotations that provide a much deeper understanding of the story, history and of the book itself. The quality of the books are nice, the text is not to fine or big to read.  I am tempted to now shell out the extra 100 bucks for the hardcover editions.  I was only a bit disappointed the shipping of the product which seemed to damage it some. (bent or crushed a bit on edges)

You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment. Pros: - This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight. - Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang. Cons: The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves. - There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before. - The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Patrick Hall	4.0	2010年1月6日 在美国审核	11	Great reading and good edition	I just want to offer my opinion about this edition (the 4 volume box set printed in 1994 [I believe it is 1994]).  The story itself is a fantastic, engaging read.  The language is fluid and I am finding that it is a lot less dry than I expected and so it is very easy to get through the book. Deciding which edition to purchase was my biggest problem, but so far, I have no issues with this one.  While I read some reviews about spelling errors--and indeed they do exist--they are not at all frequent and detract little from the story.  I also read that the characters names occur in three forms, creating much confusion.  Again, I find this to be untrue.  In fact, the narrative will often clearify who is who for the reader so you are not pondering over names the whole time.  Sometimes a character will be referred to in their style.  I don't know what that means in Chinese (it's probally in the footnotes somewhere), but the style is seperate from the surname and given name.  Most characters styles are never used, except upon introduction, so it's no issue. My advice to the reader who has never encountered the story (I have played the games and done some preliminary research on the era) is to read up a little on the history of the time.  Start with the end of the Han through the Three Kingdoms period and this will at least give you a foundation for what is going on.  It will also familiarize you with some of the names and the important players who ruled at this time. The only thing this edition could use are some good maps.  Being that it is a box set, a few seperate inserts that can be referanced along side the books would be great, but they dont have them, so what can you do. Overall, I am not at all dissapointed and highly recommend the Chinese Classics edition for the serious reader.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	T. Hooper	5.0	2005年3月6日 在美国审核	16	A Must Read	First of all, this is a classic of Chinese that is relatively unknown in the west.  This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language.  It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty.  In the process of this decay, the nation is split into three kingdoms which stuggle for supremacy.  In the process of this struggle, we find tales of friendship, heroism, betrayal, and tragedy.  This novel has thousands of characters, but perhaps the main character is Kongming, the military strategist of one of the kingdoms.  It's a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies. This translation has a modern feel, so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read.  Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow.  However, as some other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a poetic feel.  While the story has been translated, it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages.  Having said that, I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time.  Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version, such as this one.  If you read an abridged version, the story won't seem well developed.  The full text is necessary.  I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics, military science, or business.  You'll learn lots of strategies for living life.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Sean Cunningham	4.0	2013年7月28日 在美国审核	3	Good Set, Good Book	THE SET:   This is a good set if you simply want a copy of the book. Paperback, and four easy-to-manage volumes.   This is the Moss Roberts translation. So, you'll get the names and spellings you might be more familiar with - like "Cao Cao" instead of "Tsao Tsao".   It's also a good set if you plan on buying other Chinese Classics like "Outlaws of the Marsh" or "Journey to the West" because they all have uniform editions.   The only possible negatives are since they are somewhat condensing a really long novel into four thinner volumes, the actual pages seem a little thin. I worry from time to time about ripping them.   There are also a number of typos. But in all honesty, I don't really notice them. With the story moving along so quickly and the presence of already-foreign words and names, a typo now and then won't make you stumble in the least. THE BOOK:   "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is a really great (albeit long) story. This is the fictionalized story of a real civil war period in China that occured after the Han dynasty fell. The names, places, and major events were all real. The heroic actions, dialog, and minor events however are mostly imbelished or improvised.   But despite the length and complexity of the story (there are literally hundreds of characters), this book is a GREAT read. Because it has so much content to cover, the book moves at an incredible pace. Characters are literally fighting and/or dying every other page. Although you may get confused by the names, you will not be bored by anything. I often get bored by books, but everytime I pick this one up I am sucked in instantly.   And if you have played any of the Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the Three Kingdoms video games, you should most definitely read the original tale. Plus, you may have a head start on the complexity from knowing some of the characters/events already.   If you're at all interested in ancient warfare, drama, or literature, you need to read this book.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	John Kim	5.0	2013年8月29日 在美国审核	12	Timeless, classic story... great packaged set	First off... I won't waste your time in writing a review on the Three Kingdoms - I'm assuming that if you're reading this review, you're already aware of just how important/incredible/enjoyable this novel is.  Truly a great entertaining story and yet so many lessons can be learned from it.  It's no wonder why this is so widely taught in most Asian school systems. I will, however, comment on this specific 4-volume package.  This is arguably the best packaged-set available (at this time) for those that want to read the novel.  It's not a "collector's edition" - there's no leather binding or any other high-end detail associated with it, but rather it is a simple and convenient set. Unlike other versions being sold, it is somewhat smaller (I believe the dimensions are already displayed in the item details) - so it is very convenient to carry around (e.g. read on the subway, train, plane, etc).  It's broken up into 4 volumes (page numbers are continuous - so volume II starts on p597) and the overall quality is actually pretty good.  It's your typical paperback book. Prior to purchasing, I read a number of reviews complaining of how "thin the paper was" and that it made it "completely unreadable."  I did not find this to be an issue.  Yes, the paper is probably thinner than one would expect... but nothing where it poses a threat of being damaged easily or anything of the sort.  I also didn't find any issues with being able to see the lettering on the subsequent page (as its shadow is visible on the page you're reading).  Yes, it's there and yes, it's noticeable (especially when there a poem - as the poems are indented); but again, I didn't find it to be an issue. I debated back and forth on what "version" I wanted to purchase and I can honestly say that I'm quite pleased with this purchase.  It's good quality, it's packaged nicely in a boxed 4-volume set (each volume has notes at the end - so no need to search for notes in another book; as is the case with other versions), it's the unabridged version (a MUST - please avoid any abridged version - as they often leave out so much), and it's affordable (complete set costs as much as one volume of other sets).  It's also a Moss Roberts translation - something I would recommend.  And it also uses the pinyin Chinese translations (more easily pronounceable - in my opinion).  Nice introduction, good notes throughout, etc... so also a great option for those "studying" the novel. Simply put, if you're looking for a collector's edition that you're going to hand down from generation to generation with leather binding, hand-drawn images, color, etc, etc... obviously this is not the set for you.  But if you're looking for an affordable, compact, convenient, and accurate translation... then this is the one for you.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	John	4.0	2002年8月26日 在美国审核	12	for those interested in Chinese history...	Now that I finally finished the book, I will say a few words about this book.  It's a long story and it took me over 3 months to finished it.  I did enjoy this historical novel which is said to be 70% based on history and 30% fiction. The characters in the book are more alive in the reader's imagination than in the book itself because there isn't much character developement.  The book doesn't flow or read smoothly instead it feels almost mechanical.  But the events and the actions take a life of it's own in the reader's imagination.  I don't know the Chinese language but maybe there were some essence that was lost in the translation. The events and the strategy that were used in that era of history were brilliant.  Even though this happened hundreds of years ago, I have to remind myself these people were not simple, ignorant farmers.  Instead they were manipulative, calculating and deceptive as much as, if not more than the politicians that we have now. Of all the events in the book, what I still remember is how people are killed so easily and at a whim of those in authority.  No wonder so many people were in fear of their lives and what they said and did because they were at the mercy of the authority.  Another thing I marvelled at was the scale of the wars and battles they had where hundreds of thousands of people would fight and die just because their king wanted ot attack their neighbor. All said, I would reccommend this book for those who have some interest in China or that era of Chinese history.  I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the lack of the character developement which would have made this historical novel much more enjoyable and readable.

The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords. The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all: Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception, and go the obvious route instead. Basically to sum it up. 1) China splits up into a dozen warring states and warlords. 2) The "Mandate of Heaven" seems to motivate the warlords to continue fighting, thinking it's heaven's wish to eventually reunite China (which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe, with a dozen states coexisting). 3) The Art of War is known by nearly all the warlords, all the battles are very tactical. 4) If you're interested in Game theory, there are many complicated alliances, breaking of alliances and betrayals between warlords.

If you have ever played any of KOEI Dynasty Series games, then you are familiar with the Han Dynasty and some of the Chinese History. If you were interested in knowing more than what you did in the video games, then this book is for you. This is an awesome epic novel, sweeping the history of Chinese history. All of the characters that are in the Dynasty Series game are here for our further knowledge. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Lu Bu, Cao Cao, Cao Song, Dio Chan, Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Shiang San..... the list goes on and on. This story written over a thousand years ago, accurately portrays the lives and feelings of these "heroes". The author is a little swayed by the Shu family, and he seems to favor them, portraying Guan Yu, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei as the most loyal and honorable sworn brothers, with Cao Cao a sort of evil madman. But that is okay, since I never liked Cao Cao in the game anyway. All in all, this is a long and worthwhile read. I would recommend the unabridged version as it is more complete and thorough. You will not be disapointed to see these wonderful characters come to life.

Complaints about how thin the paper is I find to be unreasonable. The paper is completely adequate - now the New American Bible - that's thin paper. The typos are slightly annoying but not too much of a big deal. The translation I find to be very readable. The material is dense and the footnotes are vital. The amount of information on even a single page is astounding and does not lend itself to a quick or passive read. Anyone who has read more difficult historical works such as Thucydides or Caesar shouldn't have any problem with the style.   Like most I became aware of this story through video games, specifically the Dynasty Warriors games. The games were a good primer for the actual text, as the reader already has mental images of the characters and battles - while the mental images of the characters conjured by the games may not be historical, or accurate, they lend themselves to remembering and differentiating individuals - which can be difficult for western readers because of the Chinese names which naturally seem foreign and hard to remember to westerners. I have always had an easier time with Japanese personal names over Chinese personal names, When you start throwing in X's and Z's in the translated names, my brain just goes "What? Strange and unfamiliar!" Therefore the primer videogame course helped me immensely.   I do wish the box that holds all 4 volumes was a little more robust, but for the price of the set, I cant really complain. Overall very pleased. Now I need a statue of Lord Guan to start offering incense to the "God of War."

Whether you've been there or not, "Three Kingdoms" will provide you deep insite into Chinese History and Culture.  Encapsulated in a Swashbuckler worthy of Hollywood, it is a roadmap to over 2000 years of a culture the West generally knows so little about.  Much as the tales of King Arthur, portray Romanized Britain during the disintegration of Rome, Knightly Brothers strive to preserve the Han Empire or carve kingdoms amidst battles, plots, counter plots, seduction, and betrayal.  These are stories that, even in English translation, show us as much about Chinese thought, in the way place, time, and events are portrayed, as can be gleaned from actual dialog.  Annotated, Three Kingdoms can read on many levels from light entertainment to historic cultural education.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Etienne RP	5.0	2005年11月12日 在美国审核	30	All I Need To Know About Life, I Learned From The Three Kingdoms	Regarding the four Classics of Chinese literature, there is a popular saying that goes: "lao bu kan san guo, shao bu kan shui hu", translated as: "The young shouldn't read Water Margin while the old shouldn't read The Three Kingdoms". I did just the reverse: as a teenager living in France I voraciously read Water Margins, that depicts the lives of 108 outlaws (I knew all of their names by heart!) and is supposed to have a negative influence on young boys because of its vivid display of violence and its apology for the overturn of the social order that made it a favorite of Chairman Mao. The Three Kingdoms was not available in French at that time. I discovered this second classic much later in a Japanese translation, at an age when readers allegedly shouldn't be exposed to its depiction of stratagum, deceptions, frauds and trickeries that cunning politicians could use to their advantage. My dream is that when I reach old age and become conversant enough in Chinese, I will be able to read The Three Kingdoms and Water Margins, as well as the other two classics of Chinese literature, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber, in their original versions.

The literary style was, at first, difficult to get used to but the story itself is told in a very straightforward fashion and the characters are very rich. The constant turn of events will have you rooting for the splendid victories throughout Shu-Han's campaigns and lamenting their bitter losses. I noticed many typos throughout the entire novel but they're few and they're small enough to avoid confusion as you read. Overall I think this particular translation was excellent. It was recommended to me and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who has an affinity for this great age of chivalrous heroes and tyrannous villains.

The names are spelled correctly with grammar and general spelling mistakes being far less in this rendition. The books physical quality isnt anything to ride home about. Pages wrinkle and warp easily with some text being blurry (only a few pages). Came with a few pages already wrinkled too. Still highly recommended for someone seeking the best translation. This one even has a few pictures and maps. Get this one for reading and then find some special hardcover run for the shelf if you really like it.

As for the story itself, keep in mind that this is a book of tremendous historical and cultural importance (at least in China). If you're reading it because of that, then you're going to get what you want out of it. However taken on its own in comparison to modern works, the story itself is sort of meh, at least in my opinion.

There are typographical and spelling errors every now and then, but I mean come-on, this is a 1000+ page book published by a chinese company, it's very good that there are so few typos.  Someone remarked that this was not a good version and advised to "check your local library."  He must not know that this is considered the definitive edition of the book, and one of the best unabridged versions out there.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Jamil Bhatti	4.0	2014年3月9日 在美国审核	3	Ten thousand deaths would not deter me.	After falling in love with the movie “Red Cliff” I discovered that its’ narrative was based on this classic chinese novel. And since this story is so ingrained in the East so as to be part of the culture itself I was determined to ferret out a copy and see for myself. This is a huge book, it spans generations and took me months to read. My edition was smartly broken up into four books, so I didn’t have to carry around a huge dictionary sized brick, I appreciate that. What I didn’t appreciate was at the end of book four is a list of important characters, their descriptions and even a list of titles with definitions. How is that offensive? Well I sure could have used that while reading books one through three! Being a westerner, I’m just not that comfortable with all of these chinese names and words, some of the characters only differ by ONE letter! Not to mention most of the main characters have more than one name, used interchangeably. There are also a ton of characters, many who will never appear again, for me, someone who is not good at names, this was a bit of a trial. However, I’m glad I read this, I’m glad I own a copy, and I look forward to reading it again one day. The story itself is impressive with ample amounts of action, tactics, political intrigue, humor, and even romance. I can see why this story has endured for so long. This was not an easy, casual read for me, but it definitely deserves it’s rank as one of the four great Chinese classics.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	A.L. Moore	5.0	2008年5月25日 在美国审核	4	Most fun I've ever had with a book.	I'll be perfectly honest: I've never been one to actually sit down and read a book unless it's been marked required reading. In fact, my only fantastic literary claim up to this point was conquering the Harry Potter series. Then, I picked up these volumes. I was absolutely enthralled. I picked up this book because I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series. In fact, I just recently discovered that the games themselves were based entirely off of this collection. From then on, I had a blast both playing through the games and reading the books, trying to pick out scenarios and information the game had changed (or in some instances, just completely left out). In the process, I learned something new about ancient Chinese culture and managed to have a fantastic time doing so. I highly recommend this book. And as many others have said, do NOT buy the abridged version. Spend a little extra and get the four volume set. You'll get a lot more out of the reading.

Better value and translation than the other books that are listed, and you're getting the whole set of books instead of just one or two. I hate that I sound like I'm trying to sell the book, but really this is the best version you can buy unless you learn Chinese and translate it yourself.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Michael Tounian	5.0	2007年1月25日 在美国审核	2	The best translation available...	For Americans. Is it the correct translation? No, but that is okay, because a lot of people who buy this book will have done so from exposure to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games from Koei, and they used the Americanized spelling that unfortunately doesn't match up pronunciation wise, but the names are the same as they appear in all the games. I much prefer this, as I bought a copy of the original translation, and had no idea who the hell they were writing about. For those of us who got exposed to this, one of the greatest stories (about 70% true) ever told, having to go back and relearn all the names would be VERY taxing, not to mention annoying as hell.

Initially when the books arrived, I received a misprint where volume 1 was just volume 3 with the volume 1 binding. Luckily the seller was right on top of it & sent me a new copy of volume 1 with no issues & no headaches. It arrived promptly & in one piece. The only reason I'm giving the series 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the heavy ghosting with the text in the books. All four volumes seem to suffer from ghosted text & it can get really distracting. The text from one side of a page bleeds through very noticeably to the other side which gives me a little bit of a headache when I read for an extended period of time.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	R. Khan	5.0	2002年7月28日 在美国审核	181	Quite possibly the greatest book I've read	I first became intrigued with the Three Kingdoms's historical events when I played the game Dynasty Warriors 2 for PS2. Afterwards I was desperately searching to find the best novel translation and finally bought the 4-volume box set translated by Moss Roberts which is the UNABRIDGED version(make sure to get this edition as it tells the whole story w/o leaving anything out).I then set out to explore the 2200+ pages of Chinese history and I must say, it was a fascinating experience. I initially grasped what was going to happen in time but there was so much other details to the story and idealisms portrayed. Leadership, loyalty, heroism, military tactics and warfare, treason, and even romance play such a significant role in this epic novel. "The empire long united, must divide" and "the empire long divided, must unite" pretty much opens and closes the novel perfectly. Heroes such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, and Huang Gai portray such loyalty that it would be kind of hard to imagine in today's society. From the other reviews I've read, most people think Liu Bei (Xuande) is the protaganist of the novel and this seems very true since Roberts lauds Bei's characteristics and portrays Cao Cao of the evil and cunning type. Personally, I think anyone can choose their personal protaganist and for me that would be Zhao Yun because of his undisputed bravery and loyalty. Another character that I admired was probably Zhuge Liang for his awe-aspiring military tactics. Zhuge was the best strategist of his time and he wrote several books on warfare but unfortunately, most were destroyed but you can still buy one of his famous books, "The Art of War." Warning, spoiler ahead:   This book has its sad moments particularly when someone important or someone who contributed a lot to his lord dies. You'll feel sympathetic towards those who fought hard as well as the ones who died. When the book starts, it's during the impending collapse of the Han then around 220 is when the real three kingdoms come into play: Shu, Wu, and Wei. It's sort of like a battle to the death of who would emerge victorious and indeed there was. Military tactics are exploited on each side and betrayal is widespread. In the end, it would be Sima Yi's family who would unite China under one rule, the Jin Dyansty.

Having played a number of games in the Dynasty Warriors series, I wanted to get acquainted with the original story.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	D. Mok	4.0	2005年1月7日 在美国审核	228	A fine, if somewhat modernized, translation of the classic.	"Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is possibly the most famous and important novel in classic Chinese literature.  Not only is it the earliest of the "Four Great Books" (as evidenced by its more archaic language), but it created a complete cultural phenomenon whose impact is still fresh today -- just ask all the young people today who, without having read a word of the book, still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei.  And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book, which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji? I'd read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old, so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text.  On approaching this translation, what I find is a well done, respectful and informative translation that doesn't quite nail the tone of the original text, but will be a good read for modern readers who don't read Chinese. And to be honest, Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English.  Just the fact that subjects, articles and pronouns are often omitted from a sentence is enough to cause nightmares for a Chinese-English translator.  And even by Chinese standards, The Three Kingdoms is a work whose linguistic economy is staggering.  In one page, this book can convey the deaths of half a dozen characters, three to four battles, multiple schemes, and include four or five "tribute" poems, to boot.  Such is the style of this work, and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English.  And he has done the job remarkably, for though I don't think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language (the question is, also, whether that would have been possible), his translation makes a good read, and strives to be faithful to the original text, down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the "tribute" poems which frequent the book.  This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained. There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted, or diluted by the language barrier.  Obviously, I'm not a Chinese professor (as Prof. Roberts is), but as a native speaker, I felt his translations sometimes didn't quite hit the mark.  For example, in the original text, one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant "deception" or "guile", but Prof. Roberts adapted it to "craft", which dilutes the disapproving tone of the original.  When Yuan Shao refused aid to Liu Bei on account of his son's illness, his advice to the messenger was "if he is in trouble, he may seek refuge with me", which suggests patronage, not "find refuge north of the river", which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography.  These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs, but as a Chinese native speaker and reader, one who has grown up with this text and re-read the book hundreds of times, I still find the translation a little off.  There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language -- the translation is modern, not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text.  This may be a good point, however, since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book that's very difficult to read.  I think Prof. Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity, a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation. Again, the question is whether an English translation (or any other translation) could ever be accurate in this way to the original.  Personally, I do think many of the discrepancies in meaning could have been avoided, or ameliorated.  However, as aforementioned, for a reader who's never read the original, this issue won't affect his/her enjoyment of the text.  Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration, and for those people new to this realm, this set of books is a great discovery.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Matthew Ries	4.0	2019年9月18日 在美国审核	0	An Incredible Historical Novel	The long-lived Han dynasty is finally succumbing to effects of a weak Emperor and corrupt government that is cause injustice throughout China resulting peasant revolts while nobles strive to reform the court.  Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong, probably, dramatizes the 112-year history of the end of the Han dynasty as the empire divided into the titular three kingdoms before being reunified under the Jin while being true to history for nearly the entire text. The weakness of the Emperor Ling and his corrupt court results in the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Emperor asks all loyal subjects to come to arms to fight the rebels.  Among that answering the call is Liu Bei, a scion of the Imperial clan, who befriends and joins in a sworn brotherhood Lord Guan and Zhang Fei, Cao Cao a member of a long servicing Han bureaucratic family, and Sun Jian an accomplished general.  The numerous warlords crush the rebellion but remain in charge of various districts when the Emperor dies thus setting the stage for the warlords vying for power by controlling the child Emperor and then his young brother when Ling’s immediate successor is deposed (then murdered).  Sun Jian heads to the Southlands and founds a dynasty that is cemented by his son Ce that eventually becomes the Kingdom of Wu.  Cao Cao’s Machiavellian political acumen and military success results in him getting control of the last Han Emperor, Xian, and control of the northern heartland that eventually becomes the Kingdom of Cao-Wei.  Liu Bei and his sworn brothers bouncing from district and district trying to restore the independence and good governance of the Han but the warlords that they serve under continue to fight for their own power.  Then the brotherhood is joined by a military-political advisor Kongming that uses Bei’s connection to the Imperial house to establish power in the Riverlands, in the west of the empire, to establish the kingdom of Shu-Han.  Yet if not for the alliance between the Riverlands and Southland against Cao Cao in the battle of Red Cliffs, the three-fold division of the empire would not have happened.  After the death of Liu Bei and his sworn brothers, Kongming becomes takes up their cause by his six campaigns against Cao-Wei are not successful in conquering the whole of the Northern Heartland.  Upon Kongming’s death, the Sima family rises within the ranks of the Cao-Wei that they eventually usurp and reunify the Empire as the Jin dynasty. Though Luo Guanzhong wrote his masterpiece roughly 1200 years after the events of the novel, he used extensive historical records plus numerous legends and popular stories from the period to enhance Three Kingdoms.  The resulting novel is considered seven parts history and three parts fiction, the later portions surround the adventures and actions of Lord Guan and Kongming respectfully whose impact on history was either enlarger or their effectiveness increased.  On top of that Luo Guanzhong, along with Mao Gonggang who edited the text a century later, had a political agenda to favor Liu Bei over Cao Cao that giving the former great virtue while the latter is considered a usurper.  The four-volume 2339-page novel is an engaging piece of historical fiction with a lot of annotation, by Mao Guanzhong and translator Moss Roberts, though it isn’t perfect.  From the text itself, there are hundreds of named characters though most of them are minor characters that are hard to keep straight through the major and secondary characters are easy to keep straight.  The Chinese name convention of surname given name is followed throughout and after a while it’s easy to get use to; however one of Luo Guanzhong’s decisions was to have some individuals have multiple names, most notably Liu Bei (Xuande) and Kongming (Zhuge Liang) that at times confuses the reader.  The majority problem with the novel is unfortunately the Foreign Language Press edition that I read had grammatical and spelling errors on almost every page that too be fair was easy to read through but was a tad annoying. Three Kingdoms is a Chinese historical classic novel that I found to be a very readable novel thanks to the true to original translation approach of Moss Roberts that gave Luo Guanzhong’s masterpiece it’s full meaning.  Though most of my issues are due to the publisher’s grammatical and spelling errors, they didn’t takeaway from the great historical story that was presented and gives the reader an insight into Chinese history and cultural thought.

I have just finished reading volume 1 of this translation, comparing it word for word with a Japanese translation of the original medieval Chinese. The original language is hard to read, but Roberts nails it. I believe it will be hard to surpass the accuracy of this translation. The Beijing edition, the cheap one available here, contains all of the useful footnotes available in the UC Press edition, and relatively few typos. This classic epic novel is well-known to almost all educated people in East Asia, and if you have the time to focus on the text and remember the names of the characters, it is more engaging and thought-inspiring than a hundred books of political philosophy. Run, don't walk!
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Rivendell	5.0	2004年12月27日 在美国审核	22	A Fascinating step into Ancient China	Like many other reviewers, the way I first found out about this book was through the Dynasty Warriors video game. I decided to try reading the unabridged version, though somewhat daunted by the size. I did expect the book to be interesting, but I also thought it would be difficult reading. Little did I expect for the book to far exceed my expectations! The Three Kingdoms is a fascinating look into the history (albeit somewhat fictionalized) of China during a roughly 100 year period between 180-280 AD, during which the Han Dynasty fell(the Han was the longest lasting and most powerful dynasty according to the Afterword). The book is full of stories of honor, courage, and loyalty; as well as betrayal, cowardice, and deception. Three Kingdoms is not just a book about wars, although battle is featured prominently in the book--it spends equal or greater amounts of time peering into the political intrigue, power-struggles, and military strategy. The book is loaded with characters, which presents probably the greatest challenge to a Western reader. Learning the names of the main characters might come easier than you might think, and there is a helpful list of main characters in the back of the fourth volume (though even many of those listed there appear only momentarily in the novel). I would also suggest reading the foreward and at least the beginning of the afterword in the fourth volume before beginning the book--it will give helpful background information. The storytelling in the Three Kingdoms is so compelling that I often found myself practically cheering for my favorite characters, and often laughing out loud at peculiar victories or witty dialogue. The beginning of the book focuses on Liu Bei (Xuande) a man of admirable character and virtue, but often frustrating leadership. The main body of the book deals with Zhuge Liang (Kongming), who is Liu Bei's military strategist. Kongming is definitely the most fascinating character, and his strategies and manipulation are delightful to watch unfold. The book also has scores of heroes and villains, and gives insight into the values and virtues that were highly regarded by the Chinese. Towards the end of the book the storyline briefly begins to sag as most of the main characters die off, and yet the characters Jiang Wei and Deng Ai redeem the end of the book, and still carry on the suspense and excitement that was stronger and brighter in the first 3/4ths of the novel. All in all I was disappointed when I finished, ONLY because there wasn't more to read! I would definitely read this book again and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a true epic of Chinese history.

It is similar to Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (Based on history, but has many fictitious moments). This is my personal favorite set of books. I chose my major because of this work. Moss Roberts does a fantastic translation of a literary work that has helped shape China. The book opens with Liu Xuande (Liu Bei), Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei declaring their brotherhood. This work flows with strategy, both militaristic and political with many vying for power, with an unlikely force winning. In the end, the shadows are the way to gain overall power. This set comes with 2 books, with the first having a green cover and no real extras, and the second has a blue cover, with the conclusion and many extras, including definitions of titles, places, etc. Notes are also contained within the second volume, which greatly help in understanding the flow and historical background of the work, and a chronology of events is also placed in the second volume, with many other extras also included. Overall, an amazing translation of an amazing historic, literary work.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	NeverneverLand	5.0	2011年5月14日 在美国审核	6	You did it, Moss Roberts.  So how about doing the Jiajing Renwu version?	This translation of "Three Kingdoms", one of China's four great classical novels, is extremely accurate and reads excellently and fluently.  Roberts finds a middle ground between fidelity and spirit.  The language used is not archaic, yet the translation is faithful.  It remains one of the best translated texts of Chinese literature ever.  Roberts must be congratulated for translating a book that reads as well as it did in the original written six centuries ago. Trouble is, the version Roberts translated wasn't, textually, what Luo Guangzhong really wrote.  It was a text embellished by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang at the start of the Qing Dynasty circa 1660, 150 years after the most ancient extant text was established, that of the Jiajing Renwu edition (1522).  The 1522 edition (preface dated 1494) is known as the "Sanguo Tongsu Yanyi" (abbreviated TS by Roberts). All credit to Roberts, he discusses, with great scholarly attentiveness, the differences between the 1660s Mao edition and 1522 Jiajing Renwu (Tongsu) edition in an informative afterword.  Roberts said that the differences and literary merits were disputed amongst scholars.  But for people wanting to read a version truer to Luo Guanzhong's vision, the Maos' version is certainly an embellishment, if not an outright revision.  The differences are not minor. The question we should ask today is, should we be reading the Maos' revision of the original novel in c. 1660, or Luo's own (written around 1400)?  There are people who advocated the Mao version as the superior, more literary edition.  This is no different from scholars who used to "edit" Shakespeare to make him more palatable to the tastes of their times. What the Maos did was to add their own judgments to the text.  Luo's TS version of 1522 paints a more accurate historical version of the characters, from the historical annals Sanguo Zhi.  Some people may argue the characters might be drier, but the Maos' changes reflect their own tastes and political allegiances.  The Maos were clearly pro-Liu and anti-Cao.  Cao Cao became Public Enemy No 1, Liu Bei the embodiment of righteous dynastic rule; Guang Yu and Zhuge Liang were deified.  They divided the book into 120 chapters (the TS version was in 24 scrolls and 10 parts each (ie. 240 parts). The Maos changed 10-20% of the text.  The effect is cumulative in such a long work as Three Kingdoms.  The characterizations are changed quite drastically. To Roberts' credit, he does provide footnotes where the 1660 revised edition differs from the 1522 version.  He is right too that the Maos edition remains the most printed and read version in China, such was its influence.  But to go back to the root of Luo Guanzhong's vision, one must translate the 1522 edition. Frankly, the 1660s version isn't that bad.  It's an embellished version, more literary, and may suit certain people's tastes better.  For one thing, the line: "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide" isn't in the older version.  But since the 1522 edition almost definitely represent Luo's work more faithfully, readers should have their selection.  Since Professor Shen Bojun's magisterial edition of the Jiajing Renwu version appeared nearly two decades ago (which corrects technical errors, ie. errors in dates etc), the task shouldn't be that arduous.  80% of the text is already in the 1660s version.  Voice of hope, however idealistic: give us the Jiajing Renwu version and the Sanguo Zhi (the full historical annals) please, Mr Roberts!

Investigating I found that the game was based on Chinese Literature, a historical book written in the 1200s about 3rd Century China by Luo Guanzhong. My son promised he would read the book if I ordered it. The book as ordered is printed in China and is broken into four 600 page sections. I did buy it and with his background from the game he sailed through all 4 sections in record time with nothing but high praise. I have read it myself and highly recommend it to anyone. We have also purchased the TV serialized DVD collection, in Chinese with English Subtitles, which is absolutely facinating viewing for those who have read the original books. The DVDs require staying power there are 58 of them put out by Chinese government TV studios. The recording quality and the subtitle errors are a bit of a deterent to all but real Three Kingdom Fans. If you are expecting a slick Hollywood film don't buy the DVDs.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	presypclhs	5.0	2003年10月5日 在美国审核	36	Finally a well translated unabridged version!	And it's about time too. Moss Roberts does an excellent job of translating the epic novel by Luo Guanzhong in a full, unabridged four book series. Previously I had read an abridged version by the selfsame translator, and while I was impressed with the story, it was too choppy to satisfy me. I later found this unabridged version, purchased it at once and loved every moment of reading. This is it. The definitive "Three Kingdoms". "The Three Kingdoms" is based on the era known as The Three Kingdoms period, or San Guo Yan Yi. This period chronicles the decline of the Han to the rise of the Jin dynasty (circa AD 170-260). The story tells the tale of protagonist Zhuge Liang (referred to as Kongming throughout the story) and his efforts to help his lord Liu Bei (referred to as Xuande throughout the story) unite the land and restore the crumbling Han. You see, Liu Bei is a distant cousin of the child emperor, Liu Xian, who is manipulated by the malicious despot, Cao Cao. Bei, a poor mat weaver, steps up to the plate and helps to put down the Yellow Scarf rebellion under Zhang Jue and the story takes off from there. Zhuge Liang does not actually come into the story until much later and dies in the middle of the fourth volume, but his importance is immeasurable. This story is a must-read for history fans as well as fans of any of the video game series about the time period (Dynasty Warriors, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dynasty Tactics, etc.). Fans of the video game series will love to hear tales of their favorite characters, such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and many more. An important thing to keep in mind when reading Luo Guanzhong's novel is that it is a biased account of the events. Luo Guanzhong is what I call a pro-Shuist, or someone who supports Shu (the kingdom ruled by Liu Bei), so Shu feats may be embellished and fans of the other kingdoms (Wei, Wu) might be frustrated as many of their favorite characters will not be viewed as positively as they may deserve to be. With this in mind, "The Three Kingdoms" is a fun, if not lengthy, read and will keep you turning the pages. The story isn't terribly difficult to follow but some may have trouble keeping track of the cast of characters (some 600 plus characters in all) and all of their names. What I mean by 'all of their names' is that the chinese had the surname (Zhuge), the given name (Liang) and a style (Kongming). Some officers are called by all three names and it can be difficult to follow. Zhuge Liang is called many things over the course of the novel, in addition to his surname, given name and style, but it shouldn't be to hard to follow. Probably easier then following my explanation of it, at any rate. My major complaint with this edition (and it is minor) is the poor proofreading and the poor quality of the paper and binding. This book was published to Beijing standards and would not meet American standards. You will have to be a little careful with the book while reading it, but that's not too big of a problem. Also, the typos (two or three a chapter) can get annoying and make you wonder who was proofreading the book and make you think that you could do a better job (and you probably could). That aside, this is a very enjoyable story and you will not be disappointed in buying the four-volume unabridged set translated by Moss Roberts.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	a Seattle reader	5.0	2004年12月15日 在美国审核	6	Truly epic novel	One of the greatest of epic novels. I received this book as a gift, and I'll treasure it forever. I know I'll return to it several times in the future to reread it. The book is as long as five novels, but it's more fun than almost any five novels you could choose. The epic sweep through 110 years of Chinese history is amazing. The narrative is swift and compelling. The battles are spectacular and exciting. The characters--especially Kongming, Cao Cao, and Lord Guan--are wonderfully memorable and alive. The English translation, aside from a few typos and misspellings, is good. I don't speak Mandarin, so I wish someone would make a movie version of the story in English, or provide a subtitled version of one of the many Chinese screen adaptations. If I have one problem with the book, it's the character of Xuande. He's weak and indecisive, and lacks the qualities needed in an epic hero. It's hard to see what the other characters saw in him.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Marceau Ratard	5.0	2003年9月19日 在美国审核	20	One of the best	Like many people I first heard of this novel through the games from Koei. I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school. A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation. I had always wanted to read the novel, and I'm glad I did. The story starts around 185 AD, just at the end of the Han dynasty. It continues until the end of the Han dynasty in 220, and finally to the reunification of china around 280. The principle characters are rulers, generals, and politicians that make up the Wu, Wei, and Shu kingdoms. The book is really fast read, considering that the book is 2400+ pages long, it really didn't take that long to read. It is interesting and something is always going on. I don't think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general. They have a pretty short life. It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed, but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen. The novel does focus on the time period from 185-220, after that things start going pretty quick and after 235 AD the story is essentially over, except for a few details. I can't recommend it enough, you could read it 50 times and still get something out of it. If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be one of the books I'd like to have. Now all I need to do is visit china and see some of this stuff from the book
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Adam Alfert	5.0	2001年8月8日 在美国审核	12	The Archetypal Adventure, Chinese Style	[This review is actually for the unabridged Moss Roberts translation] This book lives up to its reputation as a source-book for Chinese adventure, politics, history, culture and just plain swashbuckling fun. For the translator, it is a work of a lifetime - this comes from an amateur sinologist who remains daunted by the original texts of works such as Three Kingdoms. Roberts joins David Hawkes in the all-time Chinese translation hall of fame. For those interested in an introduction to the drama and adventure that provide the framework for Chinese thinking about large issues such as nation-building and nation-destroying, love, honor, war and peace, this is the ultimate guidebook. Long before Gibbon wrote the "Decline and Fall ..." and Asimov wrote the Foundation series, the Chinese were obsessed with the process of dynastic change and transformation in their own country. It is impossible to overstate the role of this work in Chinese culture -- it is as if everyone in the West actually grew up reading -- and loving -- the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the sweep of history, though, the personal is not lost. Personalities large and small march across the scene and the reader is swept up in their strivings to find a place and something to strive for as the structure of the world turns upside down. For the great Han Dynasty is falling, and no one knows what new configuration will take its place. Military and political geniuses, opportunists, men (and woman, who play a significant role) of cruelty and vision emerge to strive in a chaotic arena, seeking to make their mark on the new order to come. In this sense, Three Kingdoms is a human story which repeats itself again and again, but this is one of the bejewelled versions. Roberts' translation is accompanied by extensive endnotes, which are fascinating to the Sinologist, but which cannot help but distract from the action. Reserve them for later perusal. Finally, the translator has done a tremendous job of translating the poetry in the book - often used to eulogize heroes and martyrs who give their lives out of loyalty to their leaders or who go down fighting in a losing cause. These bits of verse help to cast the necessary sense of the futility of human strivings which pervades this work and the Chinese sensibility generally. The heroes see their own deeds as tiny drops in a great river of history, and their names to be forgotten in years to come. If Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang only knew how Luo and Roberts have extended their memory in times and worlds they could never have imagined.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	24hourhand	5.0	2000年2月9日 在美国审核	458	Epic	First off, you have to read the full translation of this book.  I read the 1976 abridged version of Three Kingdoms translated by Moss Roberts first and thought it was pretty good, but felt that the story wasn't developed  enough and lacked cohesion.  Then a few years ago I finally found and  purchased the full unabridged version published by the University of  California Press and also translated by Dr. Roberts.  This is the  full-blown epic from start to finish with all the details and many of the  translation errors of the previous editions eliminated.  The prose was also  improved and flows eloquently throughout the book's entire 3000+ pages.  Three Kingdoms is the tale (part historical, part legend and myth) of the  fall of the Later Han Dynasty of China.  It chronicles the lives of those  feudal lords and their retainers who tried to either replace the empire or  restore it.  While the novel actually follows literally hundreds of  characters, the focus is mainly on the 3 families who would eventually  carve out the 3 kingdoms from the remnants of the Han.  The Liu family in  the Shu kingdom led by Liu Bei, The Cao family in Wei led by Cao Cao, and  the Sun family in Wu eventually led by Sun Quan.  The book deals with the  plots, personal and army battles, intrigues, and struggles of these  families to achieve dominance for almost 100 yrs.  This book also gives you  a sense of the way the Chinese view their history:  cyclical rather than  linear (as in the West).  The first and last lines of the book sum this  view up best: "The empire long united must divide..." and  "The empire long divided must unite..." If you are at least a  little interested in Chinese history (ancient or modern) and culture this  book is a must read.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Xueqin	5.0	2007年9月13日 在美国审核	5	Truly China's greatest novel!	When I first read Three Kingdoms it was quite a confusing story, what with all the endless characters that came and went, not to mention the impossibility of pronouncing their names properly! Nonetheless, I was captivated by the quality of the story, despite the very basic narrative style (being hundreds of years old) and the fairly simple way it must have been translated. With the amount of trials and tribulations that the reader witnesses in following the extremely incredible characters, it is no wonder that these real people from history mean so much to people today, nearly two thousand years later. Containing personalities of all kinds, Three Kingdoms offers so much wisdom and excitement, that once you get past the first couple of chapters, you are really drawn into a whole new world. To follow the struggles of men like Guan Yu, Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang as they fight for peace amongst the absolute chaos, gives hope and solutions to any of the problems one can face in today's world. Yet there are hundreds of characters who fight by their sides in attempts to reunite China, each having their own story to contribute to this immortal saga. It is truly a credit to Luo Guanzhong the way he managed to interweave so many storys, and yet stay prevalently factual. If you can get past the confusion and the slight redundancy of the narrative style, Three Kingdoms is a story you have to read within your lifetime, and preferably as soon as possible. According to DW3K.COM, there is a new version of Three Kingdoms that is to be released soon, designed to be more entertaining and less confusing than the 600 year old original. Apparently it will still contain all of the wisdom from Luo Guanzhong's, but will make a much more accessable and hopefully even more enjoyable way to learn about Three Kingdoms. In the meantime I can also suggest the other 3 chinese classics, in english known as Dream of the Red Chamber/Dreams of Red Mansions(Romance), Monkey King/Journey to the West (Adventure/Fantasy) and Water Margin/Outlaws of the Marsh (Adventure). Each are incredible stories in their own right, and are in many ways equal or even better than Three Kingdoms/Romance of Three Kingdoms.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Paco	4.0	2008年3月10日 在美国审核	1	If you know the subject	I bought the book with some background of the subject(s) so I had a good idea of what it would be like. It is written differently than most American writers' style, which may be weird to somebody that does not realize how authentic the subject and writing actually is. The book is very detailed and for anyone that loves Chinese history of the 150-200 AD period, this book will give you a good description of it. The characterization and background of the main parties is very in-depth and you get a great idea of the temperaments for all the main characters. What keeps me from giving this a 5 star rating is that some words are missed due to translation errors, as well as some poor attempts at dramatizing certain moments. Other than those few awkward moments, I am really enjoying the books. I love the story, characters and overall cultural depictions.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Jintao Wu,China	5.0	2012年3月12日 在美国审核	3	a brilliant translation but some defctive	Last year a friend of mine recommended this masterpiece of Roberts to me to sharpen my English and I found it's a masterwork as excellent as that of the original author about 500 years ago. It's said that the literature works belong to their own ethnic groups, their languages and can't be translated without losing or adding the meaning. But this epic translated by Roberts completely grasps the meaning of Chinese, both literal meaning, culture meaning and history background meaning of words, not only the surface meaning but also the deep meaning------the meaning in English is just the same as that in Chinese, no more and no less. If a Chinese author translated this middle-ages novel to modern Chinese as Prof. Roberts to modern English, he can do no more and better than Prof. Roberts. 30 years ago as a boy I read this Chinese epic of Luoguan Zhong but ignored the last 15 chapters whose content is about how "traitor" overwhelmed "loyalists" and not "political correct". But this English version read I from the 1st word to the last word including the annotation which contains many Chinese history events and lores even common Chinese don't know. The shortcoming of this translation is to non-Chinese readers, especially the English name of the people/place in this history fiction. I think western readers will be easily confused because when 30 years ago I firstly read this book I was also confused except tens of the main roles. But the translation of title is so cool. "''"(['kau'tsu]the earliest ancestor of this dynasty) and "'''''"([tai'tsu'wu'hug'di]the 1st emperor and the founder of this dynasty with many martial merits) is translated to "Augustus"-------the only and very  correct translation I think. In Chinese books about Julius Caesar Augustus in Rome history, "Augustus" is simply transliterated to "''''"[au'gu'si'du], because hardly a corresponding ancient Chinese title can be found , "'''''" is the fittest one.

I was familiar with a very small portion of the history during this time period before I read it, so that encouraged me to try it out.  If you love epic stories, this is a great one.  Guanzhong based his novel on solid historical facts while adding some fictional elements in order to bring out the characters and events for the reader.  I've heard it said, and I agree with it, that it is 70% history and 30% fiction.  Addtionally, this is a must read for any fans of the Dynasty Warriors gaming series.  My recommendation is that if you have any interest in this period of Chinese history or stories of heroics and loyalty-to-the-death, buy it, and I guarantee that you wont regret it.

I came to this novel after playing the old Koei games, and I loved reading it. My only problem with the box set is that the books' format seemed very poor to me.  After paying 50 bucks (with shipping), it was a little disappointing to realize I only got three (yes three, though the entire novel was there.  I have no idea why it says "4-Volume Boxed Set") little paperbacks, with a very very small typeset on filmy paper that is very easy to smudge and smear.  Also, there are more typos than there are hairs in Cao Cao's beard.  Distracting. I don't think you should let this deter you from reading the three kingdoms.  But perhaps, if you know you're going to love it, you might want to wait until a much higher class version comes out than the one from the university press I got.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Robin S. Slomkowski	5.0	2002年5月28日 在美国审核	5	A Wonderful Story on Many Levels - mediocre printing	This book is a truly epic tale of ancient civilization. It is a historical fiction of roughly 180-280 AD (the period of the fall of the Han dynasty), with Liu Bei and "Peach Garden" brothers set as the heros. The plot of this 2000+ page tale centers around the political and military exploits of various leaders of the age. The dissolving the dynastic rule, the rise of warlords, and the subsequent consolidation into three major kingdoms. The story telling is superb, in echoing themes from earlier chapters, and for thematically bonding disparate events and characters. The story also mixes in many different observations into the nature of morality, politics, leadership, and loyalty. This translation seems to be based on the Mao edition, the footnotes are helpful for understanding the historical allusions and identifying where the fiction differs from history. This printing has a fair number of typos, that are sad, but not very detracting from the story.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Albert hsueh	5.0	2005年7月3日 在美国审核	14	Great Chinese Classic	Four GREAT Chinese classics roam over Chinese Literature, and among those (Romance of the three kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, the Monkey King, and ShueyHudran), Romance of the three kingdoms is deemed as second place, right after the Dream of the Red Chamber. It is a work in the plot of the Three Kingdoms history book, which is written in ancient Chinese and is thus very hard to comprehend. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms however, is a very intriguing accomplishment. However, if one read the translation version, one must bear in mind that there are lots names very similar. I myself have read the Chinese version, which made it much easier to comprehend. The storyline is an adventure, and a great warning to imperialism. The three kingdoms stand in enmity and eventually none of them won. This is the Three-Kingdom tragedy, and the end of the Three-Kingdom dynasty. Lots of symbolism and fables to be interpreted. Very thoughtful and comprehensive, all plot tied up extremely conherently. The characters, as far as I know, are all real. China could not have thrived without the greatness of the Three Kingdoms, for it developed numerous Chinese proverbs, numerous location names, and numerous Gods to be worshiped. It is one of the greatest classics in the world, and it must be savored - every bit of it.

You can talk about Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and other masters of fantasy novels but unless you read this one, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. Part fiction, part history, get ready to immerse yourself in epic that is equal to none. You have just found the book of your dreams.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Faisal S. Al Essa	5.0	2007年1月28日 在美国审核	3	How to maximise the enjoyment of this tour de force	I first became familiar with the Three Kingdoms period through the video game "Romance VII" (on PS2). Through the game, I was able to understand what each charecter is capable of doing, which illustrated a clear narrative of the basic concepts involved. After playing "Romance VIII" & "Romance X", I more or less understood what the novel had to offer. After playing these games, I decided to go to the main source - the novel. While reading the novel, I started associating the images and scenarios from the games with the text. Although you will know how most events will unfold, the endless names, ranks, locations and procedures, will make sense; which without, you will be bored to death. So to sum things up, I highly recommend you play some of the romance games (in particular "Romance X") so to know how significant some events (like the meeting of the brothers, or the battle with the 'strongest man under heaven') are.

HOWEVER...There are quite a few spelling mistakes, out-of-place words, and mixed up letters (b,d and p,q).  I bought a set directly from China so I'm not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws.  They don't cause any major comprehension problems, but they're frequent enough for me to knock off 1 star. Still, this is the translation you should get, even if their proof-reader should have been fired.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Stanley Chan	5.0	2001年8月16日 在美国审核	9	My review of a great historical moment in history	I first was introduced to this story by first playing the the game Dynasty Warrriors 2 for Playstaion 2.... Even though I am not finished with the three volumes so far it has been excellent and very detailed for an a historical story that happened about two millenia ago.  I am now on the second volume and won't stop till I get to the end. One thing about these books is that it is very difficult readed and not that easy to follow at times because the names of the people can get confusing the chinese has their names, last name first and given names following and also the people in this story sometimes are called by a second name which is common in the chinese culture.  One would have to read these books at least two more times after the first to get the story down because according to my mother my grand father had read the same story in China and told my mom that he had to read it a few times to fully understand this complex time in the history of pre-feudal China and a story still being studied militarily and historically to this day.  In a nutshell dispite the difficult read and complex story which I found to a challenge it is excellent and did not before starting expect it ot be easy, is excellent for someone who wants to be challenged whether or not they have played the game or who just is intrigued by an important time in the history of China.  It is good for people just learning about this country or for some who like me have played the game and is caught by the intriguing story that the game was based on.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Amazon Customer	5.0	2003年1月17日 在美国审核	9	A Stunning Mix of Pageantry, Drama and Warfare	"What of the typos and errors?" whine some reviewers. "Or the tediousness of the story as a whole?", cry others. One even proposes the introduction of a television show based upon the events of the Three Kingdoms, so as to alleviate the "dullness" within this epic. So, before I begin my review, I must submit a brief warning:   If you possess the attention span of a five year old, have the vocabulary skills of a newborn (all errors can be corrected mentally, within seconds of their discovery)or prefer movies to books, than this is not for you. Hopefully anyone that suffers from all three ailments has not defiled this book by even considering its purchase. Enough ranting. To the book itself.   This is a passport to the ancient China of lore, where great heroes mingled with Taoist sorcerers, where the pageantry and lavishness of the Emperor's court was matched only by the suffering of the peasants at the other extreme. This is the China of the treacherous yet mighty Lu Bu, the wise Zhuge Liang, and the ambitious Cao Cao. And lastly, this is the China of the Three Kingdoms: Wu, Wei and Shu.   From the rout of the Yellow Scarves in the opening scenes of the novel to the fall of Wu and the unification of the Empire over a hundred years later, this story flows seamlessly, intricately weaving the clash and bloodshed of battle with the scheming and intrigue that fills the tale's early pages. This is a blend of fiction and fact, after all, so Luo Guanzhong does not have the ability to twist the plot in any one direction (though Liu Bei emerges as a hero to Cao Cao's brutal villain)and so some of the lesser fights are told matter-of-factly.   However, there is something about The Three Kingdoms - the Taoist magic, the great warriors, the colorful picture that the author paints of palace life - that keeps it fresh, and wipes away the dryness that fills other legends. While Jiang Wei's endless string of defeats at the end of the novel appears to grow old, it is only because the reader has grown so attached to the Kingdom of Shu that its losses are your losses, and so, when Liu Shan capitulates so suddenly, you are disgusted. But it had to occur, did it not? As promised in the novel's opening line: "The empire, long united, must divide. The empire long divided, must unite. So it has been..."
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Patrick McDougal	5.0	2003年12月24日 在美国审核	7	Not for casual reading	I'll admit, I purchased this novel because of the addictive Playstation 2 games put out by Koei that are based on the Three Kingdoms story and characters.  Even being relatively familiar with the characters and plot, I found the novel to be very difficult to digest, if only because hundreds of characters are introduced (and often killed or left behind) every few pages.  The storyline is vivid and interesting, and this is an excellent novel.  This version is very helpful due to extensive endnotes and a preface and afterword that fleshes out the background and meaning of the novel.  I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in political and military adventures, but you should be prepared to invest substantial amounts of time in reading it.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Van N. Tran	5.0	2001年6月15日 在美国审核	7	Three Kingdoms	It is an excellent novel and the translation is great. When I read the story, I felt like I traveled back to the history, and witnessed the events unfolding in front of my eyes. The story depicts the loyalty, integrity, sacrifice, friendship, betrayal, treachery and human fragiltiy. Today, I can not imagine someone  can match the characters of Lord Guan and zhao Zilong for their loyalty, integrity, courage, and sacrifice. I was also amazed , perhaps, intrigue about the Emperor Xian who somehow could not seek the service from Li Xuande and his people. Perhaps, the Chinese history would have a new twist if Emperor Xian had used Li Xuande to protect the Han dynasty.  Sum it up, the reasons or culprits that led to the collapse of the Han dynasty or any other dynasties later in Chinese history were due a weak ruler, abuses of power from eunichs, or misuse of talents in the court. The irony is nobody could imagine that, in the end, the entire realm was united by Sima Yan to found the Jin  dynasty but not by Cao cao, or Li Xuande or Sun Quan as the three main characters in the story of the three kingdoms that fought against one another.

First of all, I want to say that this is a complete version of  "Three Kingdoms", not an unabridged one. The Foreign Language Press published this English translation made by Moss Roberts, in four volumes and 2340 pages, which include many notes, several drawings and some maps. The edition was very carefully done. About the content, I just can say that it is a monumental painting of humanity made through the light of a very difficult time in China history. One hint: at the end of volume four, a list of principal characters is included, which results very useful along the reading. As always, thanks to Amazon that brought this book to my hands.

I am a history major and plan on being a novelist someday, writing ancient historical-like novels.  Thus this, and several other books, are prime for my reading list... but as a general novel I found this book lacking.  This is probably because it is translated but I found this book to be choppy as well as lacking in descriptive writing.  Sword fights between two major figures last for one or two sentences max.  There aren't any vivid descriptions of anything.  I'm not someone who needs two pages describing a flower (the worst case of long unnecessary description I've come across), but I would like to know what a character looks like more than just his height, or what a building or city looks like.  Surely major battles involving thousands shouldn't start and finish in one or two pages.  I suppose that this story could have been twice as long had he allowed descriptions, but I would have enjoyed it a bit more.

In chinese we called 3 kingdoms as 70% facts, 30% myths.The main character is considered Kongming: --Kongming , a brilliant military leader and politican ,but his talent was exaggerated in the book, in formal history ,his main credit was to save the kingdom of Shu from the Wei's menace. --Sima Yi :this man is a master schemer,a superb politican and military leader.  Sima did not want a total war with the Shu because as long as Kongming ramained a menace to  Wei kingdom , he is  still useful with the Cao's family.And by distinguised himself by battles with Kongming , he gradulally gained control of the Wei ,and finally it was the Sima's family who unitied China and declared themself emperor. --Cao Cao: the Chinese love this man ,his brilliant as well as his ruthless.He was never a king , but one of the most emperor in China's history changed his nickname to Cao Cao , and Mao ZeDong writes poems to praise him. Cao Cao was extremely suspicious :" I would rather betrayed the world than have the world betrayed me". A good comapre to Cao is Stalin.

None of these is as readily accessible to younger readers as this set of books is.  There is more action in one page of this book than any book I've read before.  And similarly, the dialogue is quick, to the point, and wastes few words.  Descriptions are minimal, explanations brief, and intrigue constant.  If you're someone (like me) that grew up on video games and television, this is likely a book you'll easily get into, likely enjoy, and almost definitely learn much from.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	S. I. Song	3.0	2005年1月13日 在美国审核	16	Lost in Translation	The Three Kingdoms have been, since its creation, the staple of literature in the Orient. It has been translated into Korean, Japanese, and numerous other languages and has been read by scholars, historians, and military strategists everywhere in Northern Asia. However, as anyone who has already read the Three Kingdoms in any of the North Eastern Asian languages will promise, the English version unfortunately does not capture the essence in which the "Odyssey" of China rose to its widespread fame and ubiquity. It lacks the characterstics that demand to stand as one of the greatest historical and legendary pieces in existence today. That is why it is literature, not simply history. The artistic hand of Luo Guanzhong is almost wiped off and a bland history with awkward word choice is left that leaves little to imagination and wonder. For people who are interested in the epics of Chinese literature, to gain a simple understanding of the events and perhaps some of the strategies, the book can be recommended. However, to truly appreciate the epic that has created sayings that if you read the story three times, you can be deemed a scholar, the translation simply lacks too much. It is unfortunately, another case of great literature unable to be shared since it was lost in translation.

Seeing  some reviews said that Liu Bei is the main hero of the novel ,in China we disliked and considered him a man who know nothing but cry and a demagogue . the  most fascinating character must be Cao Cao , the translation missed some quotes of him , and even the famous seven battle of Kong Ming with the barbarian ,of which he captured the rebel's leader ,realesed him ,and then recaptured..... Even with the best translator there are still some  poems, words.... that seem impossible to translate into  english , if you know chinese try to buy this book in chinese.

And let me tell you somthing this book is the best book ever!! It has a huge stand point on war and art. This book is the Unabriged version and has a lot of names but you will get the main people in the story. For any of you who have played the viedo game, forget everything you know because it's alot different. I give this book 5 out of 5. The version should be bought because Robert Moss has about 200 pages of helpful quotes, pictures, and maps.

It takes you back in time and shows the culture, drama, and situation of China around 190 to 220 AD. You will find yourself reading the first chapter and not wanting to stop. The epic book does well by hooking the reader in.   However, there are many characters in which to remember. Luckily the characters themselves, can at many times, be distinguish from each other. Very good book indeed!

The pages are really thin and there are a lot words that are spelled incorrectly. Thankfully, the words are fairly easy to figure out, but having to solve the occasional word puzzle in the middle of the story can be quite annoying. This is still one of the greatest stories ever written and an excellent buy.

Moss Roberts has done a good job translating this vigorous history of alliances, betrayals, bravery, cowardace, and greed.  It isn't exactly a historical novel as there are many supernatural elements, but you do get a good feeling of what life was like in those turbulent times. He cleverly puts the analytical essay at the end, since most of us wouldn't appreciate it if it had been at the beginning.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	The Lord Guan	1.0	2009年3月4日 在美国审核	9	Disappointing	I am a big fan of The Three Kingdoms saga.  I wanted a version that in my mind was worthy of the wonder and significance of the work.  This version, for the cost, is very disappointing.  I am through the first nine chapters or so, and I must say that this version does not live up to expectations.  I see typographical and spelling (!) errors on seemingly every other page.  There are also numerous references within the text to other works and versions that make me think there have to be more comprehensive, superior versions out there.  I wanted a version that I could hang onto for decades, something worthy of prominent display on my bookshelves, and this one isn't it.  If you are new to the ROTK world, this could be a great introductory work, but only if it were $40 cheaper.  Avoid and instead try the local library.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	I. Galis	1.0	2008年11月17日 在美国审核	29	Very inaccessible classic. Dry translation.	First off, I want to make it clear that I respect the people who love and enjoy this novel. I do not think that their opinion of it is somehow "wrong." The following, however, has been my experience: Among East Asian classics, and among Chinese classics, this novel is one of the least accessible to the average English-speaking reader. The way in which the story is told is extremely dry and downright baffling to someone schooled in Western literature. The writing had no emotional resonance ever. The lack of emotional resonance is expected, seeing as there's very little description of anything beside physical occurrences, which are summarized in very succinct form. (i.e. Character 435 stabbed Character 762, then rode to [the city of] JFDFSDG and stabbed Character 953). This sort of sentence compromises the entire book. Basically, it reads like a reference work. It's not a "novel" as most western readers would be accustomed to thinking of one. Even if you're open to forms of literature that are drastically different from anything else you've read (as I was, going into this), you'll probably find yourself too exasperated by the novel to finish. It was really a painful experience for me. However, all is not lost for the person seeking an entry into Chinese literature. I recommend Dream of the Red Chamber as a good starting novel, especially the translation published by Penguin under the title "The Story of the Stone" (don't be discouraged by the alternative title, it's the same novel as Dream of the Red Chamber). Furthermore, Red Chamber was written in the late Qing, which makes it more relevant to the modern history and identity of the region we know as China. Those looking for older quality pieces of writing from East Asia as a whole may enjoy The Tale of Genji and The Tale of the Heike more than they would enjoy Three Kingdoms. Both "Genji" and "Heike" are lengthy novels of Japanese origin, with Genji often being considered the world's first written novel, and certainly the first in East Asia. To all, Good luck in your readings.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Joaquin	5.0	2018年4月3日 在英国审核	22	A true masterpiece	I'm assuming anyone interested enough to read through reviews of Three Kingdoms needs no convincing in terms of the story itself. It is, without questions, a superb epic and more than worth anyone's time (of which you will need a lot if you are to finish it). In light of this, my review will focus specifically on Moss Roberts's unabridged edition of Three Kingdoms. To anyone wondering whether to go with Brewett-Taylor's 1920's translation or this one, I say look no further. To begin with, Moss Robert's translation uses the all but universally adopted system of Pinyin, whereas Brewett-Taylor's (published before Pinyin was devised) used the Wade-Giles romanisation system - now out of use everywhere except Taiwan. Thus, when Moss Roberts writes "Cao Cao" and "Sima Yi", Brewett-Taylor writes "Ts'ao Ts'ao" and "Ss'uma Ii". Not only are the Pinyin names in wider use now, they are also easier to read. Secondly, the language is far more accessible in the Moss Roberts version. This is not to say that it is dumbed down - quite the contrary. The translations of the poems and couplets are beautifully rendered and capture the emotional tone conveyed in the original Chinese very well; they even rhyme most of the time. Lastly, this revised edition contains a long list of vital characters, footnotes, an expanded set of illustrations and maps (the maps come in handy when trying to visualise key battles and events). There is also a superb afterword which, at 120 pages long, does a great job of contextualising the novel in terms of its place in Chinese culture and historiography. It sorts fact from fiction, for anyone interested in the historical aspect of the novel (it is, after all, a romanticised and often fictionalised account of the period). These three facts alone place the updated Moss Roberts edition far above Brewett-Taylor's in my opinion. Nevertheless, this edition is not without flaws, and I would be remiss not to point them out. Firstly, there are the typos. It's a shame that the editor didn't or couldn’t to sift through them in earnest, as they are both numerous and grating. Secondly, the quality of the cover, the box and the paper, doesn't live up to the content - particularly given its cultural and historical significance. Lastly - and this is the big one - there are the spoilers. Yes, you heard me. The spoilers. While the introduction and the footnotes do a superb job of clarifying, contextualising and elaborating, they are also often guilty of revealing the turn of events long before the reader has got to that part of the story. Thus, we are told the ultimate fate of Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang, Cao Cao, the Wei, the Southland, and the Shu, far in advance of getting there ourselves. Unless Moss Roberts thought that only those already versed in the historical period of the Three Kingdoms would read this, I cannot fathom why he would deem it appropriate or even necessary to reveal such things to the reader without warning him first. I suppose this was published before the phrase *spoiler alert* was coined. I would therefore be inclined to recommend that readers who wish to remain unspoiled avoid the introduction and the footnotes sections altogether. However, given how useful the footnotes actually are (for the most part) in terms of aiding the reader through esoteric references to historical figures, historical events, and cultural themes, I cannot endorse that recommendation fully. It is a shame, because the footnotes are essential to all but the most well versed sinologists, and yet they ultimately rob the reader of the pleasure of being surprised at crucial points in the story. However, despite these flaws, I still loved Moss Roberts's edition. It's easy to tell how enamoured and engrossed he was by this story, and his passion shines through in this beautiful translation, promising to make for a spectacular read. I, for one, look forward to rereading it in the future.
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Laurence D	5.0	2015年3月19日 在英国审核	5	Tough read, but satisfied after finishing	I bought this way back in 2009, and I didn't finish it until 2012. I wasn't reading it continously the whole time - on and off, rereading parts when I left it for too long. I think I read the first volume 3 times. This generally is not a hugely enjoyable read, when reading it, but I'm still glad I did. There are 4 volumes in a slightly flimsy cardboard cover to keep them together. The pages themselves are extremely thin (paper-thin...), but even though I traveled a fair amount with some of these books stuffed in a bag, the pages never got ripped etc. The pages maybe need to be this thin so that the books aren't ridiculously thick. There are some pictures and maps in the books, but I didn't use them that much. You will need a second bookmark so that you can refer to the footnotes at the back of the book that are constant throughout the books. Often these footnotes give an alternative translation from another source, which aren't that useful, hut sometimes you need them - a character may have last appeared 1000 pages ago, and you need a reminder of who they are. The translation seems pretty coherent at least, but certainly doesn't portray the poetic nature of the original Chinese. At the time I bought this, there was one other translation version that the reviews said is more poetic (I think it has actually been uploaded to read for free online, since it's from the 1930's or something). I chose this one for no partucular reason, but for me I'm glad I did, because trying to read this is a semi-poetic language woypd have increased the challenge even more. But maybe that's just me, I couldn't finish LoTR...
10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Paul Mattis	5.0	2009年9月30日 在英国审核	15	Influential piece of work, presented pretty well	Three Kingdoms is, for the uninitiated, a (partly fictional) account of the events leading up to the transition from the Han Empire to the Jin Empire in China during the last part of the 3rd Century.  The story is, in the Far East, an iconic tale, with characters and events spawning idioms and influencing the actions of strategists, general and rulers for centuries to come, not to mention the countless media interpretations, such as the John Woo  movie 'Red Cliff' and the video game 'Dynasty Warriors' series. The entire story covers almost 100 years, and the breadth of characters and affiliations in the era is so great that it was inevitable - in addition to bias - that the carriers of the tale would caricature most of it to create a simple 'good vs. evil' tale.  So, once the several hundred pages of set-up are complete - which is good in itself, as the united heroes face rebel Yellow Scarves, scheming eunuchs, evil Dong Zhuo, valiant Lu Bu and arrogant Yuan Shao - the story turns into a struggle between the virtuous Liu Bei, the treacherous Cao Cao, and the opportunistic Sun Quan.  But it's the supporting cast that really make the story work; the iconic Guan Yu and Zhao Zilong, the semi-comedic Zhang Fei, and the multi-gifted strategist Zhuge Liang carry Liu Bei's cause, fearsome Zhang Liao, enduring Zhang He and the Machiavellian Sima Yi fight for Cao Cao, while the jealous genius Zhou Yu, painfully noble Huang Gai and prodigy Lu Xun support Sun Quan.  And that's nowhere near all.  None of the portrayals are historically accurate - some being downright unfair - but it makes an epic read nonetheless. The main attraction is the lack of that aforementioned simplicity, however; the Wu kingdom provide the Liu Bei cause with the ally they need to defeat Cao Cao at Red Cliffs, but end up being the cause of his downfall later as the two sides argue over the provinces of Jingzhou.  And after that, well... read and learn.  The 'plot twists' of this 3-way power struggle are pretty much the bait and hook, with the fate of Guan Yu needing especial mention. It has to be said, however, that for some readers, the style may be uncomfortable (not to me personally, but other people I have shown the book to have said this).  The story often shifts between the different groups, sometimes covering three or more sets of characters at once, and many amount to nothing more than exposition.  This version also features a lot of translations of poems and sayings that can, to anyone not interested in Chinese culture, seem superfluous.  The final 15 chapters also lack the scope of the earlier ones, as all of the main characters are no longer present for whatever reason.  Repetition is something else I hear aimed at this novel; well, history has an annoying habit of repeating itself, with generation after generation refusing to learn from very-well-documented mistakes.  This is, in fact, part of the point the novel makes, with mistakes seen at the start being repeated by the next generation at the end, with similar consequences. All in all, this is a book I actually returned to more than once, and there's enough to keep a person looking for depth and scope reading for a long time to come (it's already been a staple read in China for 1700 years, so there you have it!). But for 'Reader Lites' out there, there are other ways to enjoy the story... other book translations, John Woo's Red Cliff, subtitled copies of CCTV's 82-part TV series, and I even understand there's a graphic novel version if you know where to look. Either way, give this tale a try; you won't be disappointed.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Proops	3.0	2008年12月17日 在英国审核	3	Do you have the stamina for this?	This is a semi-historical epic set about 1700 years ago, telling of the growth of factionalisation and political intrigue in China that resulted in outright war. Essentially this is a story of a number of heroic figures and the battles they wage with each other. The main characters are pretty interesting, particularly the deviously clever Cao Cao. But the story lacks the fantastical element of  Outlaws of the Marsh Vol 1-4 , or indeed its humour. It's certainly a more challenging read. The notes to the edition are excellent, so if you want to know about the history of this period and see this in a semi-fictional context -- think Tacitus  The Annals of Imperial Rome (Classics)  if you've read him -- then this is great. It just wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention for the 2,500 pages it takes to reach its conclusion.

10	三国演义	Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	Moss Roberts	Philip Smith	2.0	2018年6月7日 在加拿大审核	1	One military skirmish after another ad nauseum	It takes well over 300 pages to get past the initial, and perpetual, internicine military battles and skirmishes, all of which are described summarily. When the book finally lets up on the constant military skirmishes and battles, it does so only briefly and in doing so becomes somewhat more nuanced with some scheming, lying, backstabbing, etc. Opportunism abounds in these sections and often, but not always, trumps loyalty and honor - changing factions and turning on one's leader is a fairly common occurence here. At 892 pages in, the book has only very briefly broken free of its military confines - Three Kingdoms mainly deals with a power struggle, the outcome of which is determined mostly through military actions. As far as I can tell, there is little to be found in the book that isn't related to this aforesaid power struggle and associated skirmishes and battles, so it's not going to appeal to people who are looking for something profound or insightful (outside of military tactics). Initially, I enjoyed the simple straighthtforwardness of it, despite finding it to be lacking in more subtle forms of expression, such as can be found in other classics such as The Tale of Genji, Hamlet, or The Brothers Karamazov, for instance. I've grown tired of it though as military scheming and fighting is virtually all the book is about and at that, it isn't done very well, especially by modern standards - just brief, matter of fact accounts along the lines of "Then he struck ××××× a single blow, and he fell dead from his horse." I usually have lots of patience for older literature (I read and enjoyed War And Peace,  Don Quixote, and the unabridged Life Of Johnson, and countless other old books, for example), but I fear my patience has run out here...essentally it's been a  waste of time and money (bought the whole unabridged Moss Roberts translation). I kept reading it due to all the positive reviews, hoping it would improve.

11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Bernie Gourley	4.0	2017年3月28日 在美国审核	24	A Chinese Folklore superhero story featuring the Monkey-King	If you’re familiar with any Chinese folklore, it’s probably this story. But you probably know it as “Journey to the West.”  It’s not only been released in numerous editions as a novel, it’s also been adapted for film, stage play, and I’m sure there must be a video game of it out there. If you’re thinking, “Chinese folklore? Sounds boring.” Think again. This is a superhero story. Monkey, also known as the Monkey-King and “Great Sage Equal to Heaven,” is an immortal who has all manner of supernatural powers. He can fly. He can make copies of himself. He can transform himself—either disguising himself as another being or appearing as an inanimate object. He has an iron truncheon that can be the size of a sewing needle or a mile long and which is indestructible. Wielding said staff, he can defeat armies or deities. In fact, the flaw in this story isn’t a lack of adventure or thrill. On the contrary, it’s one adventure after the next. If anything, the flaw is “Superman Syndrome.” That’s what I call it when the hero is so ridiculously overpowered that even when he’s fighting gods, dragons, or whole armies there’s still no doubt about the outcome. Of course, the Monkey does eventually meet his match in the form of the Buddha. The Buddha defeats Monkey not in combat, but in a bet.  That event shifts the direction of the story. In the early chapters, Monkey is goes about heaven and earth arrogantly wreaking havoc. He’s not altogether detestable. He does have his redeeming traits, but he’s insufferably arrogant and mischievous. After he’s imprisoned following his run-in with the Buddha, a monk is assigned to go to India to bring back scriptures (hence, a “journey to the west”) to China. Monkey is assigned to be the monk’s guardian and along with two others that they pick up along the way (Pigsy and Sandy) the monk is escorted on his journey. The party faces one challenge after the next, and the trip is long and arduous. Some of the challenges require brute force but in many cases they are battles of wits. So while Monkey may be overpowered, he does experience personal growth over the course of the story. The story is told over 30 chapters, each set up with a cliffhanger. I enjoyed this translation by Arthur Waley. It is end-noted, which is useful given the historic and cultural nuances that may not be clear to readers. It should be noted that this is unambiguously a Buddhist tale. There is a bias against Taoists and other non-Buddhist religions evident throughout the story. It’s not just the fact that the Buddha easily defeats Monkey when no other deity or group of deities can, there’s a steady stream of anti-Taoist sentiment. So, Taoists and Chinese Folk Religion practitioners be warned, I guess. I would recommend this book for fiction readers, particularly if you have an interest in the superhero genre or Chinese literature.

Waley is the greatest of translators from Chinese.  While this is abridged and cannot match the magisterial but stiffer version of Anthony Yu, it is just right for an introduction to this fabulous work. Many who read this will want to tackle Yu. Many others would not wish it longer than it is. Waley occupies a happy position at the boundary between these two groups.

Wonderfully funny and sometimes poignant ancient classic novel about pilgrimage by the wild and resourceful Monkey King and the diffident Tripitaka, Monkey's nominal master. Here's one of my favorite quotes from the novel. "They travelled on for many days and autumn had already come when late one evening Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, 'Disciple, where are we going to halt to-night?'  'Master,' said Monkey, 'that is a question for ordinary men to ask, not for such pilgrims as we.' 'Wherein lies the difference?' asked Tripitaka.  'Ordinary people at this hour,' said Monkey, 'are hugging their children or cuddling their wives in soft beds under warm coverlets, lying snug and comfortable as you please.  But how can we pilgrims expect any such thing?  By moonlight or starlight on we must go, supping on the air and braving the wet, so long as the road lasts.’"

Keeping an open mind while reading makes for a better experience.  Monkey is a lot like you and me.  He does the hard work to become enlightened and a standout person only to become a stronger egocentric narcissus blind to the rights and feelings of others.  But he is finally chastised for his behavior and learns to be true to his word and use his powers to help others and in the process does not lose any of his essential essence that makes him who he is.  It is a fine tale masterfully written and fun to read.  There is a reminder here that we all have something of a “Monkey Mind” inside us.

The monk travels westward to spread buddhism but has quite a journey.  The read journey to the west is too long for undergraduate students.  So I can assign this to them since is only about 300 pages.  The full length translation by the same person is 4 volumes and about 1200 pages.  I recommend the full length version if you are reading for your personal enrichment of reading a Chinese classic.  If you just want a quick read to understand the legend better than any movie, TV show, or children's book, then this is a fine abridged version of the translation I enjoy most and bought the last time I was in China.  To be honest, none of the popular culture shows or childrens' books I have seen here, or in China, are anywhere close to the actual book.  They just borrow some of the characters and call it Monkey King.  This is the real deal and, thus, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! One of my favorites ever!

The pre-chosen descriptions of the plot mood, characters and pace that Amazon provides are no match for the wonder of the book. Monkey has entertained children and elders in China for 1000 years. There are movies, songs, and spin-off tales. Donnie Yen just did a new movie in 2014 based on this book,and in 2013 Journey to the West was released in theaters. That's the mark of a book with staying power!  It's a fun read with twists and turns and magic and all the splendor and wonder you expect from China 1000 years ago. Think of the most sensational and unreal Kung-Fu movie you ever saw with flying swords and beasts and rooftop fights, magic fists, Crouching Tigers and Dragons and mystery. That is this book in it's ancient glory. You may love this, or you may find your child enthralled with the characters, plot and wonder of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, or the Jade Princess, or the demon catcher...

Others are familiar with Pokemon's Infernape.  And still more know a similar character from a TV miniseries shown in the US in 2001 called The Lost Empire.  Rumor has it that Jet Li will collaborate with Jackie Chan to portray a Sun Wukong-like character in the forthcoming movie The Forbidden Kingdom.  What fans of these characters may not know, is that they are all based on China's infamous Sun Wukong--or The Monkey King. The tale of the Sun Wukong is one of the four major Chinese literary classics.  His 81-chapter story, called Journey to the West (Xi You Ji), was written by Wu Chen-En  in the 1500s.  Monkey's legend is based on the true story of a well-known monk, Xuan Zang (602-664), who traveled to Inida to bring the Sutra--the Buddhist holy book--to China to enlighten the people and improve their lives.  In Journey to the West, however, reality gives way to a much more entertaining and fantastic version of the story. Journey to the West is a hero's quest, elaborated with Monkey's supernatural powers, interlaced with Taoist and Buddhist practices and beliefs as well as common superstitions, embellished with fairy tales, monster stories, legends, and fables.  Some of the chapters read like superhero comics, others like instructional Bible stories.  Some parts of the story, as when Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy are hiding in a Temple and outwit the priests, are downright hilarious.  The Sun Wukong legend can be read as a hero-journey-quest, a political and social satire of rebellion against a corrupt government, or as pure fancy.  No wonder Journey to the West has endured for so long. It's hard to believe that as popular as Journey to the West has remained over the centuries, its author would never have admitted to writing it.  Wu Chen-En was a scholar and a statesman.  During the 1500s (Ming Dynasty), it was considered unfit for educated and high ranking men to read any kind of comic or popular literature.  Wu was influenced in writing this tale by the super-hero stories he read secretly while in school. The entertaining escapades of Sun Wukong have remained popular through the ages, inspiring operas, cartoons, and now movies.  The tale has even spawned a Sun Wukong festival, which features recreations of many of his adventures, and a statue of Monkey stands at a Buddhist temple in Sau Mau Ping in Hong Kong.  Chairman Mao was also a fan, who mentioned Monkey as a role model in many of his speeches.  He said people should emulate Monkey's fearlessness in thinking, doing work, striving for his objectives, and extricating China from poverty.  Sun Wukong is well-known and well-liked in modern times among children in Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and Korea.  I think Wu Chen-En would secretly be very pleased!
11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	A. Silverstone	5.0	2006年1月9日 在美国审核	14	Excellent Translation of Chinese Classic	Monkey (or the Monkey King or The Journey to the West) is one of the great epic novels in Chinese culture.  Set in the 6th century, but not written in the current form until the 16th century (it was part of an oral tradition before that), the story is on the surface about the pilgrimmage of a Buddhist Priest, Hsuan Tsang, and his 3 disciples/side-kicks: Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy, as they journey to India to bring back sacred scrolls from Buddha.  Arthur Waley has done a truly impressive job of translating, editing, and bringing to life a selection of the stories (30 from 100 original chapters) from the original Chinese book.  He retains the complete first section about Monkey:  How he was born from a stone, the trouble and mischief he caused on earth and in heaven, and how he reached the title of Sage, Equal of Heaven until getting imprisoned in a stone under a mountain.  Waley then presents a selection of the adventures that the 4 cohorts encounter in their journey to find the scrolls.  Each of the adventures follow the same theme of encounter a difficulty, i.e., some people in trouble, help the people to overcome the difficulty, usually through magical or supernatural powers, and then move on.  By translating an abridgement, it prevents this repetitive style from dragging on, and it stays fresh.  In addition, to the basic story line, one learns much about ancient Chinese culture, Buddhism, and some about Taoism.  Moreover, the 4 pilgrims rather than being model characters are actually quite flawed, which makes the stories fascinating, because it always requires a group effort to surpass each hurdle.  This is a wonderful book.  Translating from contemporary Chinese to English is difficult enough, but from 16th century Chinese, Waley has done an amazing job.

"Monkey" is the story of the Monkey-king, acting as a guarding of a Buddhist monk in his travels to the west. Don't let this description mislead you. It is not a lofty, religious book. It IS an action-packed adventure thriller, with some touches of philosophy and fantasy. What I liked most about this book it is that it does not obey the norms (or guidelines) of western literature. The heroes can be cowards, betrayal is completely expected, good and evil are not opposites. Very refreshing, and keeps you on your (mental) toes. Highly recommended!

She looked for books that had a beautiful flow to the language that would attract even the baby, simple enough basic story lines that the little kids would enjoy it, enough adventure to attract the middle kids, and deeper, subtler meanings to engage the older kids and adults. This one, Monkey, by Wu Ch'eng-en, translated by Arthur Whaley, was top contender, and I heard it read aloud many times in my childhood, always with enjoyment, always learning more. (The other most-repeated books were Kipling's Kim and Tolkein's The Hobbit.)   It is the story of the irreverent magic Monkey King who had adventures on earth, tricked a sage into teaching him the secrets of magic and immortality, and then created havoc on earth and in the beaurocracy of heaven. (Mama explained that the idea of beaurocracy is deeply ingrained, and that people tend to imagine their afterlife to be ideal versions of what this one might be.) As punishment Monkey was imprisoned for 500 years under the Mountain of the Five Elements, and as penance was to accompany and protect the priest Tripitaka on a journey from China to India to bring back copies of sacred scrolls, to bring the true teachings of the Buddha to China. They had adventures. And the author pulls us from one to the next with hints. ”If you do not know how far they still had to travel and whether disasters still awaited them, you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.”

This is a very readable translation of a portion of the epic, at the cost of context and a degree of accuracy. However, if you want to just read the story and enjoy it as a story, this is probably the best version. Deeper retellings are a slog to get through and unless you really want every drop, you're better off with a version you'll complete.

11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Seriously Honest	5.0	2012年5月15日 在美国审核	1	One of the Greatest of All time	This novel - and it is much more than that - is considered by the majority of people in the world (Asian) - one of, if not the absolute greatest writing of all time.  Shakespear but with more fun, meaning and breadth of meaning and effect - to each - and through each stage of life. It is originally written in 4 good sized books and has been translated to English as well (as other languages) many times.  In many things translated, it is hard to reflect the flow and cadence of things, as well as reflect the sometimes culturally derived understandings and appreciations of things, and so much more.  Especially true with this where not only are there magnificent stories, a poetry and social commentary (and more) in one. This abridged version notes it tries to capture only the major and translatable stories in this absolutely magnificent piece of literature, while maintaining as literal translation of the words as possible.  Great writings, dreams if you will, are great almost in spite of dialect not just because of them.  This is an example of that. The selections and presentation succeeds in all regards and you are swept into the writing and can feel and be washed away in joy and thought by it.  It is entirely comfortable for we US type readers.  (So great is what you get that it even makes me jealous of those who have the ability  to enjoy it exactly as it was written - as many have said for generations - it can be life alteringly powerful). This is a very approachable read for anyone with a US/anglo perspective - and as recommended to me - the best one from that point of view.

It is China's equivalent of the Brother's Grimm. If you enjoy fairy tales, you should buy this as it is well written and not tedious as other versions are. Aurthur Waley did an excellent job of making the story a joy to read. You can even read this book to your children the same way you would read any fairy tale book to children. It is nicely organized with each chapter as a separate episode or story that allows for a pause between chapters without losing the overall arc of the story. It is entertaining, and has hidden gems of both wisdom and mystical teachings for those who have the eyes to see. In other words, you can learn advanced spiritual alchemy from this book if you are paying attention. Secret lore hidden in a fairy tale! Ironically...it also shows Buddhism's nastier side. Few people know that even the Buddha himself had no problem using force to "convince" others of the superiority of his argument. Or that there is no such thing as mercy and forgiveness in Buddhism. The wheel of Karma...divine punishment... is merciless and inescapable. And refusing to bow down and know your proper place in the hierarchy... is an unpardonable sin. A great read!

Hu	4.0	2012年1月11日 在美国审核	4	Great introduction to Journey to the West...just wish it was a more complete translation	I grew up on "Journey to the West", having read it in various Chinese versions catered for easier reading, children's books, even comic books. This translation captures so much of the same humor and personalities of the characters that it was just as enjoyable as the Chinese version. But a big downside is that it's missing so many of the best adventures of the original story. That means we miss out on many of the Monkey's crazier transformations, the beasts and gods and their magic and weapons, and more of the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters. It was like reading part 1 of a trilogy; I wish he had simply translated more. Nevertheless, if you are new to this story, this is not to be missed--a very good introduction to one of the greatest Chinese stories ever written.

No laughter here, just snoring.  Do not read this for pleasure, you will regret it.  Only buy this book if you have to read it for class.

All translations fail to some extent, wordplay and jokes are lost, meaningful phrasing is lost. All abridgments will leave out parts that some people love or feel are indispensable. That being said ... The Grove Press edition of Arthur Waley's translation of   has been on my bookshelf since about 1955. It is not the same physical book. The original fell apart after much re-reading. I have let friends borrow the book and have despaired of having it returned. I have read several other translations and none of them satisfy me. Friends who know, have told me that the Waley translation is the only one that retains the wit and flavor of the original. I believe that. The next best translation, oddly, is a translation from Chinese to Czech, then from Czech to English. There are things that some people may find off-putting about Waley's translation. Those who are finicky about such things may think the deliberate attempt to retain the spirit rather than the exact phrasing to be distasteful. Waley's scholarship was excellent and he could have chosen to write it word-for-word, but he did not. His version is similar to Coleman Bark's translations of Rumi such as  , true to the intent, meaning, and flavor rather than a mechanical replacement of words. The criticism that I would have to agree with is simple, there isn't enough of it! I know that an abridged version is the best that we could hope for (and even so, some of the reviewers here have complained of its length) but I sometimes hope that a cache of unpublished chapters will be discovered. Until then, however, the distinctive white, black, and orange cover of the Grove Press edition of the Arthur Waley translation of Wu Ch'eng-en's Monkey will have a place of honor on my bookshelves.
11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Loren D. Morrison	4.0	2000年6月5日 在美国审核	12	Buddha of Precocious Merit	In the preface to his translation, Waley tells us that the author of MONKEY lived between 1505 and 1585 A.D.  The protagonist of the tales, Tripitaka was a real person, better known to history as Hsuan Tang, who  lived in the seventh century A.D.  There were contemporary accounts of  Hsuan Tang's pilgrimage.  These accounts, along with a cycle of fantastic  legends that began appearing around the tenth century A.D. and the stage  presentations which began in the thirteenth century provided the source  material for Wu Ch'eng-en's wonderful tales. (This is Waley's  spelling.) The first seven chapters are dedicated to telling Monkey's  story up until the time he became Tripitaka's disciple.  Monkey, mostly  through trickery has become more powerful than most of the gods and has  rebelled against them until he is finally overpowered and imprisoned in a  block of stone.  He is freed in order to become the first of the three  disciples. In chapters eight through twelve we are introduced to Hsuan  Tsang (Tripitaka) and learn about the origins of his pilgrimage to India.  The balance of the one hundred chapters are dedicated to the pilgrimage  itself. Early in the pilgrimage, Tripitaka acquires two additional  disciples, Pigsy and Sandy.  Each of the three disciples has been placed in  Tripitaka's path by the gods, and each has unique magical powers.  Without  these powers, and the support and encouragement of these sometimes  reluctant disciples, the pilgrimage would never have been completed, as  there are no end of dangers, evil-doers, and monsters to overcome, and  because Tripitaka is a rather weak and timid pilgrim who needs constant  encouragement. The pilgrimage does end successfully and Tripitaka and  each of his disciples are rewarded in heaven as follows: Tripitaka  becomes the "Buddha of Special Merit." Monkey becomes the  "Buddha Victorious in Strife." Pigsy becomes "Cleanser of  the Altar." and Sandy becomes the "Golden Bodied  Arhat." As is befitting for a book about a spiritual, though  physically challenging, adventure the author ends by dedicating these  hundred chapters to "the glory of Buddha's pure land." We are  told that these tales are for the entertainment of children and adults  alike.  While I agree that this is true of the content of the tales, it is  my opinion that reading this translation would be difficult for young  children. There are translations available that are written in more child  friendly language.  For any reader of mythology, MONKEY should be a welcome  addition to your reading list.

Fasih	5.0	2016年12月15日 在美国审核	0	“What you must do," said Monkey, "is lure the monster from its hiding place, but be certain it is a fight you can survive.”	This is the full audio version of Arthur Waley's book "Monkey", itself an abridgement of "Journey to the West". Enjoy one of the pillars of Chinese culture, the story that permeates the fabric of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese film, literature, and manga, from "Monkey Monkey" to Dragonball, as rendered by a brilliant Sinologist, while stuck in your car. Kenneth Williams, the voice actor, wasn't ever given a Wade-Giles pronunciation chart, and so butchers Xuanzang's name, but luckily Waley renders it as "Tripitaka" for most of the novel, which Williams can't get wrong. Williams has a thick Received Pronunciation accent (that's the Queen's English for you non-Brits) which many will find hilarious, and which some will find unbearable. The story itself is quite funny in many places, even if it does drag (and if you think Waley's abridgement is long, wait till you see Anthony Yu's four volume complete English translation). It was written down some 400 years ago, and was a popular and widespread folk tale for at least 400 years before then, so don't expect the pacing of a 21st century novel. Monkey masters Daoist magic and after making a name for himself on earth, gets invited to Heaven, where they can keep an eye on him. He makes a mess of things there, then flees back to earth, and fights off the Heavenly Court's greatest warriors trying to take him back for punishment. After another stint in Heaven, he runs amok and, crime of crimes, eats the Jade Emperor's favorite peaches. Oh boy. For wreaking havoc in Heaven, the Buddha himself finally throws Monkey down to earth, puts a mountain on top of him, and tells him to think about what he's done. Five hundred years later, the Buddha takes pity on the barbarians living in China and directs Guanyin, the goddess of mercy, to order a holy man from China to travel to India to get authentic Buddhist scriptures. She picks Xuanzang of course. The merciful goddess offers Monkey absolution and enlightenment if he lays aside his vile Daosit magicks, takes up the one true path of Buddhism, and serves Xuanzang on his journey to the west. Monkey has "help" from a pleasure-seeking pig, a quiet water spirit, and a dragon prince who transforms into a horse, all of whom are to be Xuanzang's disciples. Let's just say that priests will do what priests will do, and between naughty shenanigans, mighty battles, and a coup d'etat, the scriptures are fetched from India and conveyed back to China, this time by a magic cloud, before the whole party is taken back to Buddha's Shangri-la to live forever, rescued from the wheel of karma and reincarnation. (Also available as an MP3 CD:  . This review is from my review there.)

Clarke	4.0	2003年3月11日 在美国审核	52	Exuberant fairytale with an edge	Unlike most people, I didn't come to this book through the TV series - I have heard of it, but I've never seen it (although I do intend to try to find it now...). This translation covers only sections of the Monkey/Journey to the West saga, but what there is of it conveys well the flavour of the tale without outstaying its welcome. The plot, such as it is, revolves around the priest Tripitaka and his disciples (including Monkey), who have been charged to journey to the West and return with Buddhist scriptures for the enlightenment of China. The story can, at times, be distinctly difficult to get your head around; superficially at least, it's little more than a succession of episodes involving bizarre monsters being defeated with elaborate magical powers. There is, however, plenty of humour - generally farcical in nature, although occasionally quite dry - and the bickering of the main characters is frequently entertaining. The bureaucratic nature of heaven, in which spirits and deities are assigned strictly hierarchical posts - with salaries! - is amusing regardless of how much you know of Chinese history and society. However, many of the Buddhist and Taoist elements may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the basic concepts. Some of the episodes rely quite heavily on outcomes grounded in, say, the workings of karma or the achievement of enlightenment - although most do conclude with Monkey and friends beating up the monsters in question, frequently with the spiritual aid of Kuan-yin and other divinities. But I do suspect that there are allusions and layers I'm missing... To paraphrase the end-of-chapter refrain, if you want to know whether Monkey and his companions succeed on their quest, you'll have to read the book!
11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Devlin	4.0	2003年3月18日 在美国审核	16	A shortened version of Monkey's wacky hijinks	Waley's abridged translation of the popular Chinese classic Journey to the West is an approachable version for the initiate but I strongly recommend W. J. F. Jenner's excellent full and unabridged translation, also available from Amazon. Waley's abridged version concentrates mainly on the beginnings of the pilgrimage (e.g. Monkey's origins, his bid to overthrow Heaven, his subsequent imprisonment, his rescue by the holy pilgrim from Tang, and the conversion of the other disciples) and only a couple of the adventures along the road to Buddha's Western Paradise. Jenner's translation, spread over four volumes, covers all these and much more - a total of 81 adventures and misadventures spread over 100 chapters. If you like Waley's translation, go on and get Jenner's fuller version. Monkey is China's version of the universal trickster-hero. Jenner captures all of Wu Cheng En's sly humour, and you cannot help but laugh out loud when you read his translation.

But I could not put it down and finished the whole of it in two sittings! This book is as much of  a page turner as any modern novel, using everything from cunning plot turns  to end-of-chapter guises ("And if you don't know what became of them,  you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.") to absolutely  hilarious anecdotes. (I laughed aloud at the "Taoist Holy Water"  episode!) An amazingly well-crafted novel with a very very fluid  translation that makes it an absolute delight to read. Again: I could not  put this book down! The fight scenes were also spectacular...[still  panting, having just finished the book]...you must read this book! =)

On the road from China, to Gondaro Will they make it, Nobody knows. This book titled 'Monkey' is the same Monkey many of us know (And most definetly should love) from the television series also called 'Monkey'.  They were both taken from writings penned by Wu Ch'eng-en, who lived between 1505 - 1580.  This translation is absolute joy to read. It is the story of a noble Chinese priest on a journey to find the scriptures of India for his God, Buddhu.  On his travels he encounters three part-men part-animal part-naughty-and-therefore-punished creatures who journey with him in his misadventures, in return for going to heaven. It combines in its reading beauty with absurdity, profundity with nonsense, Folk-lore, allegory, religion, history, satire, and poetry.  You will never read anything like this ever again in your life.  SO GO AND BUY IT NOW!!
11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Jack Washington	4.0	2007年1月20日 在美国审核	4	Ancient Chinese Huckelberry	A blurb from The Nation describes the book as a "combination of picaresque novel, fairly tale, fabliau, Mickey Mouse, Davy Crocket, and Pilgrim's Progress."  I would add to that list The Divine Comedy, The Odyssey, Huckleberry Finn, 1001 Arabian Nights and modern political satire.  But despite the seemingly esoteric description, it is a light, breezy novel.  The reader doesn't need to know who Lao Tzu is to laugh when he pinches Monkey and tells him "Be off with you, be off with you, and don't let me find you hanging round here [heaven] anymore."  The reader doesn't need to have a few University years of Chinese fiction or philosophy under the belt before laughing at Monkey stuffing himself with the Jade Emperor's peaches.  Nor, even, does the reader need to be steeped in morality, for, though having early attained immortality and, we all know, on fast track for Buddhahood, Monkey still likes to crack a dragon joke before clobbering one over the head with his cudgel in "a real garlic-pounding blow that will finish him off for good and all." Waley's translation flows lightly, using a vernacular that is simple, easy and inviting, and, at the same time, reminiscent of the sagacity of the veteran Boddhisatvas, many of whom make guest appearances.  It is a beautiful, wild, fun story centered around a stone-born ape, aka Monkey, aka "Aware of Vacuity," who tromps the world over in search of mischief, power, peaches, sacred texts and enlightenment.  Strikingly similar to 1001 Arabian Nights in both form, wisdom, and content. "I wonder whether a knowledge of the True Scriptures would not cause some improvement in them?  Do you yourself possess those scriptures?'" asked the Bodhisattvas!  `Yes, three baskets of them,' said Buddha," and the journey begins...

It is a fairytale as well as a satire and a historical fiction based on the true events of Tan San Zang (Tripitaka in the book). With the outline of Tan San Zang's pilgrimage to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures during the arts and cultural Bronze Age of China, the Tang Dynasty, Journey to the West expands his perilous journey over the Gobi desert, Kyrgyzstan, and other Silk Road routes to India in an ingenious way. As a satire, Monkey unleashes the imagination against the cultural backdrop of China. It plays on the three major religions and ways of thinking of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism and blatantly and playfully laughs at them. Like a good joke, one who pokes fun at oneself- it is not hard to see why Monkey has become a favorite Chinese classic touching every mind, young and old. Other than being a satire, like most fables and fairytales, Journey to the West has imbedded moral values that can be found. The characters are fictionalized, except for Tripitaka, and are governed with checks-and-balances. Tripitaka is not too far-fetched from the original Tan San Zang conducting the same pilgrimage, yet he is portrayed as a feeble monk who often "cries like a woman" but his tenderness can move his disciples. Monkey or Sun Wu Kong is witty and the most powerful of Tripitaka's disciples, yet his downfall is his arrogance. Pigsy, another disciple is slow but he is none-the-less loyal and brave. Sandy, also one of the three disciples is mostly along for the ride but he represents sincerity. Even though a big part of their journey is out of this world, taking place in the heavens, the underworld, or under-the-sea worlds, their lively characters embodying their flaws and assets can be related to by anyone who tried to get along with another person. Lastly, the translation of the book by the famous Arthur Waley preserves the comical essence of the book. Furthermore, the most important sequences of Journey to the West can be found and enjoyed in his translation of Monkey.

Judd	3.0	2001年7月6日 在美国审核	22	a relic	Monkey, also known as The Monkey King or The Journey to the West, is one of the four great novels of China--along with The Water Margins, Dream of the Red Mansion, and The Three Kingdoms.  It tells the story, in allegorical form, of Xuan Zang (or Hsuan Tsang), a 7th Century monk who trekked from China to India in search of Buddhist texts, his translations of which were a key to the growth of Buddhism in China.  His real-life travelogue is itself considered to be a great work of literature, but for purposes of the novel he, referred to here as Tripitaka, is given a group of comic companions : the Monkey King, a kind of trickster god, who represents rebelliousness against both heavenly and earthly order;  Pigsy, a marshal of heaven turned into his animal namesake for attacking a fairy maiden, who represents a sort of earthy stolidity; and Sandy, a kind of sea monster, who Waley says represents "whole-heartedness", whatever that means. The book is intermittently amusing, but even in this abridged version is way too long.  Characters' motivations and the meanings of most of the action are awfully obscure.  And like any picaresque, it is almost purely episode driven, without the various episodes necessarily adding up to a coherent and sustained story.  The book is interesting as a cultural relic, but, if no one told you, you wouldn't imagine it to be such an influential text. GRADE : C

When I read this book for my Chinese literature class this semester I couldn't put it down. Though it is abridged from 100 to 30  chapters, most of what is removed is not as interesting. The best part  about Arthur Waley's translation of "Journey to the West" (he  renamed it "Monkey") is that he is one of the first to play up  the very hilarious humor in the book, though there is of course a quite  serious religious undertone to the whole thing. This is an amazingly funny  story from the Ming Dynasty, which will not disappoint any fan of fantasy,  peculiar humor or spiritual quests. A true classic of Asian literature.

A glance through these reviews and I don't see that anyone has caught the fact that this translation contains barely 1/3 of the original Chinese book. Admittedly it's the only game in town, but this is still significant information.
11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Nicholas Webb	5.0	2002年8月16日 在美国审核	31	This book defined my childhood	I first recieved this book as a ninth birthday present from an adult friend who lived in Thailand, and upon reading its first 13 chapters the book quickly became my favourite fairy tale. Monkey's absurd arrogance is funny, but, by the same token, his optimism and self-assurance is infectious. He thinks nothing of travelling from heaven to hell and all points in between (Solving problems along the way by banging a few heads together) or of achieving immortality by stealing peaches. The story of how he got his great weapon (A staff used to hammer the Milky Way flat) by essentially being the worst guest in history to a much put-upon sea dragon, is hillarious. The book, suprisingly for one written 500 years ago in a distant land, contains some of the best-timed slapstick comedy I've ever come across. There is even one moment of true toilet humour that will have you reaching for oxygen, it's so funny. The pace kept up brilliantly; the final scene of the books first act, in which the forces of Heaven attempt to trap the Monkey King, has the air of a Keystone Kops episode by way of JRR Tolkein. However, there are also moments of touching and disturbing drama, as Monkey's personality gradually shifts from mischievious to almost evil, until he is imprisoned beneath a vast mountain and begins the long road to his redemption and eventual enlightement. I haven't even talked about the main plot of this wonderful story, but it is better if you discover it for yourself. Enjoy!

My current read is The Epic of Gilgamesh (the completion of which is frequently interrupted by returns to the masterpiece you are reading about).  Previous to reading Monkey, Dante's Divine comedy ranked highest on my list.  My interest in the anime and manga story Dragonball (and subsequently, Dragonball Z) turned me onto the Story of Monkey and The Journey to the West. Comedy is the word I would use to describe Monkey, moreso than Dante's work.  The central character's rise to glory is so colorful and intricate, one cannot help but laugh.  The introduction of Kwan-Yin brings a serious aspect to the tale and a more admirable goal, but the focus on Monkey keeps the nature of the journey in check.  Despite the absurdity of the characters Monkey and Pigsy in particular (though not them alone), the story maintains a very epic feel. This version (up until Kwan-Yin's introduction) deals very little with all the Buddhist dogma that permeates the story.  Even afterward, Monkey's mission is at the forefront.  The author has done a fine job making the tale accessible to everyone (being a white, American, Christian with appreciation for Buddhism and Taoism) and has cut much non-essential dialouge. One thing I had to get used to was the structure of the text.  Paragraph breaks are not always used and oftentimes, conversations are not broken up in the traditional "..." he said "..." she said" format.  Oftentimes, many quotes are strung together before you know who is saying what.  The style takes a little getting used to, but this book still gets 5 stars.  BUY THIS BOOK!  You will not regret it.

This is an excellent level book which you'd never guess is as old as around 500 years. Beautifully translated into English, but a level of English that is easily accessible to just about anyone. It's a beautiful read and very inspiring if you are travelling somewhere but also inspiring even if you're not. Sometimes the chapters are short and sometimes they're long but either way they are never boring.

Whole periods of the story can pass in as little as a paragraph (or several years pass without mention), and there is no clear timeline. Also, the Chinese translation in to English seems wrong in some parts - either by phonetical spelling oddities, or interpretation of meanings taken literally, instead of understanding a saying or pun. But overall, not bad. I'd say this is a good general overview of a story, but if you want to indulge in to this story, it would be better to seek a full translation - which I plan to do, someday.

11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Arynth	5.0	2003年7月10日 在英国审核	88	One of the four classics of Chinese Literature	I read this after having read the excellent San Guo Yan Yi (The Three Kingdoms/Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which I would highly recommend) and, having known a bit about Chinese culture, language and literature I went into it knowing what to expect and was delighted that it had surpassed my expectations. Most often referred to as Xi You Ji or, Journey to the West, it is difficult to appreciate why the author chose to call it "Monkey". While the character of Monkey does occupy much of the first part of the book and remains the strongest and, I'm guessing, most people's favourite character throughout, he is still only part of the entourage of characters who face the Journey. Still, what's in a title? This book is replete with humour, both obvious and subtle. It would help if you had a certain understanding of Chinese History and culture in your reading of this book to understand the many references contained within. However, even if you don't know a jot about anything to do with China, you will still find this book immensely enjoyable and full of quotable wisdoms. It details first the story of the birth of monkey and his fate and then the birth of "Tripitaka" and then begins the Journey to the West. It might often appear a bit disjointed, leaping around topics. For example, you begin with the story of Monkey, and are then thrown into a (seemingly) completely unrelated topic. But the way Wu Cheng'An has worked all these plots into a coherent story is truly brilliant. Instead of finding it disjointed, I found the the jumps kept the book very exciting. While there are certain parts of the plot which I assume are composed according to the epic style of the time (for example, all the battles take place in rounds, or bouts, and seem to follow a standardised format of engage and retreat/chase), these don't detract anything from the novel to one who is used to epic literature (for example, the battles in the Iliad followed a pattern). In following the path of Tripitaka, Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy you invariably pick your favourite for each has their own individual personalities and stock epithets. Pigsy is fat and glutenous and fights with a rake (!) and perhaps is one of the funniest charicatures in the book. Monkey is a mischief maker, both loveable and naughty with fabulous powers. Sandy... doesn't really do much. Tripitaka is hilarious simply because he is portrayed as the hero of this book but spends most of his time being rescued by his disciples! It truly is riotous. Thus, even if you fail to understand the relationships of the San Jiao (Three teachings of Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism)or the nature of the bureaucracy (the way heaven mimics earth), you will still find this one of the funniest reads of your life. Enjoy! (The other three classics of Chinese literature are The Three Kingdoms, The Story of the Stone/Dream of the Red Chamber and The Outlaws of the Marsh and I highly recommend all of them)

The basic premise of this novel, in Chinese pinyin "xiyouji" which literally translates to "Journey to the West", sees a group of four set out on an epic journey to recover the Buddhist sutras from India and bring them to China. On the way they encounter various monsters, ghosts and demons trying to stop them. The four represent different sides of human nature, their journey to the "West" (actually India) mirrors the human journey of life and whilst Heaven is awash with bureaucracy, the Earth is littered with challenges and obstacles. The Monkey King is perhaps the most famous character of all, bold, proud, brave and cunning, equipped with a magical staff, the ability to transform himself into over 70 different shapes and a whole host of magical powers. Tripitaka is the monk, humble, kind and naive, the epitome of the Buddhist devotee, but not averse to reciting a curse that can keep Monkey under control. Pigsy is the third main character, representing greed, sloth and lust, usually to be found eating, sleeping or chatting up the ladies. Sandy is the fourth, but pretty non-descript member of the group. The story is humorous and satirical. It contains a lot of references to Chinese history and elements of Buddhism and Taoism (Daoism) which can be a bit confusing if you have no previous knowledge. Arthur Waley's translation is only a fraction of the original tome however, and those looking for a genuine translation of equal depth to the original should look elsewhere. Think of this as a distillation of some of the best bits. Perhaps you need to live in China to realise just how important this novel is, not just as a piece of historical writing, but also in the Chinese contemporary imagination. If you're interested in China and Chinese cultural mythology, you should definitely put this on your reading list!

Those of a certain age in the UK will remember the Japanese TV series of a Chinese folk tale, well this is the book where it all began. This is the story of a Monk tasked to collect holy scriptures from the India and bring them back to China. On his travels is his accompanied by Monkey, a mischievous, impatient immortal Monkey King who was punished for causing trouble in Heaven and, after 500 years being stuck under a mountain, agrees to protect the priest to atone. Also travelling with the priest in hope of atonement are Pigsy, cast down from Heaven in to the form of a pig demon and Sandy, also cast down from Heaven into demon form. The English translation leaves a lot of the story out, only 30 chapters versus the original 100, but still manages to tell a good story. However I would recommend buying the physical book. The Kindle copy contains a number of OCR errors, where the publisher has attempted to convert the physical book to an ebook. Even with the latest updated version you will see the odd 2 or £ in place of z, 1 in place of ! etc. It is a shame as with just a little bit of effort this could be fixed.

I've read this to my son as a bed-time story, over many nights, and he loved it. It's a real magical story that does not age. Love it.

11	西游记	Monkey: Folk Novel of China	吴承恩	Arthur Waley	Nigel Collier	3.0	2000年1月4日 在英国审核	28	Stylised and stylish saga	I bought this book after running a web search for the TV programme 'Monkey' and thus discovering that the series was based on an ancient Chinese story. This abridged telling of the story is obviously well  translated - the English is very rich and - where some differences in  language could not be literally resolved (like when Chinese wordplay were  rendered irrelevant) there were useful footnotes.  Waley has gone against  the convention for previous translations of the Monkey story; he has  rendered a small section of the saga in its entirety rather than covering  the entire story in a much abridged form. I found the story fairly dense,  it is very stylised and so fans of Chinese history and culture will love  it.  I was surprised by how malevolent the Monkey character was and by how  antagonistic the relationships between him and the other main characters  were. For those fellow fans of the TV programme, roughly half of the book  comprises the story of Monkey before the TV show - i.e. the story of how he  rose from a simple monkey to become an Immortal and a Monkey King.  The  rest of the book describes the quest of Monkey, Sandy, Pigsy and Tripitaka  to retrieve scripture scrolls from the Buddhas of India.  This part of the  book was most like the TV show - a series of sub-quests or episodes with  the team of characters resolving sub-plots (like ridding a village of some  evil ogres who plague and bully them) but I found they became slightly  repetitive and hard to follow (due to the plethora of Dragon-Kings,  heavenly locations and minor deities, and the inconsistent wielding of  magical powers which made me think, "well if you have THAT magic  power, why didn't you employ it in the last chapter when it could have  easily got you out of that tight squeeze?"). The story is full of  allegory and subtle humour and satire - but I suspect it was slightly too  highbrow and subtle and buried in the Chinese imagery and language for me  to appreciate fully.  If you liked the TV series then the familiar names  have some nostalgia value but the book is slightly hard work - and the team  of characters not the jovial tight-knit bunch I remember; indeed there  exists between the main characters throughout the book a sense of mutual  dislike which gave the book, I feel, an uneasy and uncomfortable  atmosphere.

Es liest sich wie eine Satire an Heldenlegenden und ich glaube, das ist auch beabsichtigt. Ein wichtigtuerischer, kleiner Affe der sich gleich selbst als König krönt und das große himmlische Reich an der Nase herumführt. Er bestiehlt, beleidigt und verkloppt jeden, der ihm krumm kommt und wo er ein Ziel wittert, ist er mit Eifer bei der Sache es zu erreichen. Monkey ist ein Anti-Held und seine Geschichte bis heute eine der bekanntesten Legenden aus Asien. Wer DragonBall kennt, wird merken, warum der Anime von diesem Buch inspiriert wurde. Das Buch ist in Englisch, aber tatsächlich sehr einfach zu lesen und zu verstehen auch für nicht-Muttersprachler. Ich empfehle trotzdem ein minimum von B2, sonst schlägt man jedes zweite Wort nach.

This book is like a Kung Fu flick from the Tang dinasty and it's a delightful first step to study the chinese literary tradition.

IT is great for all those, who cannot be bothered reading the big novels. But, I have to admit, I found it very short. There were time when I was wondering, why has this been shortened, and why has this event been excluded altogether? However, for a summary book, this version is very good. I enjoyed the funny side of Wukong very much, the terribleness of the Pig  and the seriousness of the Master. Something that was really great was to read about their loyalty to each other. The translations were really great, but at times there were a few typos. However, the storytelling is great, I read through the book in two days. It made me want to continue reading, to see how each quest ended. I can truly recommend this book to anyone who is somewhat interested in the story of the Xuanzang's journey to the west. It has everything a good book needs, humour, seriousness, action and a deeper meaning. :-)

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	RDD	5.0	2021年1月17日 在美国审核	0	A Classic Text for Literature Scholars	Wu Cheng’en’s sixteenth-century novel “Journey to the West” tells the story of the pilgrimage of Buddhist monk Xuanzang to the “Western Regions” of Central Asia and India in order to obtain Buddhist sūtras and return them to China between 626 and 645 CE. Xuanzang wrote his own account in 646, “Great Tang Records on the Western Regions,” which formed the outline of Wu’s novel. The novel is a humorous adventure that satires Chinese bureaucracy while also telling an allegory of enlightenment. Many in the Euro-American world know elements of the story from Arthur Waley’s 1942 abridged translation, “Monkey: A Folk-Tale of China,” while some elements of the story inspired Akira Toriyama’s “Dragon Ball.” Along with Luo Guanzhong’s fourteenth-century novel “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” Shi Nai’an’s fourteenth-century novel “Water Margin,” and Cao Xueqin’s eighteenth-century novel “Dream of the Red Chamber,” this novel is one of the Four Classic Novels of Chinese literature. This edition presents the complete novel in four volumes, translated by William John Francis Jenner, a noted sinologist who completed this translation while working for Foreign Languages Press between 1963-1965. It features Qing Dynasty illustrations to supplement the text.

With that said, there was a particular choice made in translation that I found immensely irritating - U.S. Standard units were used, and just substituted in for Chinese units. Li became miles, span became foot, so on and so forth. The other Chinese Classics don't do this, and it was disappointing to see here. There were also some odd translations within the descriptions, such as describing instances where monsters were pounded into pulp as "like hamburger". These are minor flaws, but they still grate.

However, it is definitely worth the effort. This is not considered a classic for nothing. For those not familiar with the story, it is a mythological recounting of the adventures of an actual Chinese monk who travelled to India through countless perils. Probably the closest in Anglo-Saxon tradition is Beowulf, which recounts Scandanavian history in the same way. Journey to the West isn't simply high adventure, though. Each of the adventures explores specific issues and the Chinese Daoist interpretation. It is thus intended as educational. As a guide to thoughts strange and alien to western minds, it is second to none. Teaching stories exist in many ancient cultures, but none are as comprehensive.

It is published by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing. I suspect this a government organization. I do not read Chinese, so I cannot say anything about the translation. But I like this version. It is poetic and appears to be complete--it is over 2500 pages long. This is a pure translation, each of the four volumes has about three notes at the end. There are other translations that explain everything. Those explanations are not essential to enjoying the story. I recommend this version if you just want to read a great story.

First of all, this is one of the four greatest classics of China, which already merits your attention. To be more specific - this is an epic full of the most diverse adventures, in the style of the glorious Ancient-Greek  Iliad, Odyssey and the Tasks of Hercules. However, strangely enough, this can also be a written description of a computer game, full of battles against ferocious dragons, monsters and corrupted leaders - religious or civil - passing from level to level, till the happy end. The heroes also carry all kinds of special weapons and possess supernatural powers - belonging to a culture that has probably inspired also those very computer games. These heroes' purpose is double - fighting against evil creatures, and refining their own selves in order to reach heavenly immortality. They are three,- symbolizing the three parts of each body. The witty Monkey represents the intelligent resourceful brain. The pious monk Sanzang is the compassionate heart, and Pig - the village-fool - is the greedy stomach, providing the many humorous episodes. In short - never a dull moment. By the way, the Monkey also becomes a monk, and the unintentional pun Monkey-monk provides us with hilarious instants... The first chapters describe how Monkey was born from the primordial union between Heaven and Earth from a stone-egg, and how he defied the heavenly rulers, wrecking havoc in their lofty palaces, ruining their peach-feast, stealing the pills of immortality, winning by ruse a wondrous weapon, subduing ferocious dragons as well as many troops of heavenly soldiers, being cooked in a furnace just to win all-seeing golden pupils, erasing his name from the records of the underworld, thus making himself immortal - and more such brave and indeed incredible feats - only to be subdued, finally, by the great Buddha himself. His only way to release himself from his eternal imprisonment is - to help the pious monk Sanzang, whose life-story is most touching, make the 36,000-miles-journey to the west to fetch the scriptures for the impious easterners. On the way they're surprised by seemingly impossible tasks, such as crossing huge seas or lofty ridges, and in addition they meet all kinds of unimaginable powerful fiends, which they must fight according to the different circumstances. Each battle is described in a short free poem, just as the breathtaking views of the mountains, brooks, rivers, storms, flowers and birds are described lyrically. Each of the many adventures - about 60, at least - is self-contained, and so, even if the reading stretches over several months - nothing's lost. The reading is easy and pleasant, and mostly - encouraging - since each battle symbolizes our own daily hardships, and so each victory is ours too!!.. Since the book concentrates mostly on the versatile ever-lasting fight between Good and Evil, with very little romance, for example, it could be read by any child, just like fairy-stories. And so, whoever is looking for a present for a youngster, even 10 years old, or whoever is willing to teach a computer-addicted boy or a teenager to dedicate some time to simple reading - this is the book for the task!! Plus, whoever is willing to enjoy a long journey from China to India, with everything it has to offer - sceneries, people, trades, spirituality, vices, different habits of many countries - at least twelve are mentioned - and also visit many levels of heaven and even the underworld on the way - and get out of it intact - all this without leaving the comfortable home and even bed - especially during long cold nights - just step out and invest in buying this book - it's simply indispensable!!!  A personal confession - I happened to be born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese astrology, and on the day of the Monkey according to the Mexican astrology - so I'm a double Monkey, and I'd detested it!!! Till I've completed the reading of this book. Now I can be proud of myself, just for having such a representative in one of the most fascinating specimens of the world literature - the most charming Monkey you'll ever meet!!! :-)

I have been wanting to read this book and am very happy with this particular translation. It is written is a poetic yet easily understandable way. The 4 books are bound in a nice cover. A couple previous customers commented about the thinness of the paper. For me this was a good thing. I was concerned that 4 600-page books were not going to fit on the shelf, but due to how thin the books are made I do not have this problem! This is a delightful read and a great edition! Highly recommended.

I can follow the story across the blank pages, but it is annoying.  But other than that I love the language used in this translation.

Jenner	J in NE	4.0	2006年11月24日 在美国审核	17	Achieve a state of childlike amusement on this humorous adventure...	5 stars for the translation.  4 stars for the physical book quality. Since other people have expounded on the plot, here is a review based on the physical book. The actual paperback novels are approximately 7" x 4.25," so easy to hold in your hand and tuck into a briefcase.  The pages are a bit thin, not "Bible" thin, but they are a bit thinner than most paperback books.  One of my volumes didn't hold up well to sitting in a steam-filled bathroom. There are occasional pictures and sparse endnotes, but they do not detract from the story at all.  The pictures were drawn during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and are done in the old chinese style, not some new-fangled doodles. Some of the translation is a bit iffy, and sentences do not necessarily always make sense, but you'll understand it contextually.  Some of the wording is extremely quaint, such as Pig complaining that the demons failed to drink "acuppa" with them.  There is much more painfully British vernacular, but it just adds to the goofy charm of this book.  Don't bother wringing your hands over the never-ending list of characters.  Skim over them and read on.  After all, there are an awful lot of demons and gods to meet on the journey, and quite a few of them are fated to die via Monkey's cudgel, making their characters irrelevant in the long-run.  One thing I noticed is that there is an awful lot of scatological farce for a book written in the Ming dynasty (don't worry, it's still hilarious). I've read a couple translations of Monkey King, and while they'll all stay in my personal library, this is the one I anticipate picking up again and again.  I loved this book as a child and ten years later, I still do.  A must-read for fans of mythology or Chinese literature in general.

Sure, the paper is paper-thin and cheap, but if you hold it up to the light you can read both sides at once, saving time.  Stop whining- for short money you are getting almost 2400 pages of the finest mythology, religion, spirituality, allegory, folktale, humor, and monkey butt-kicking awesomeness.  My favorite book in the world, bar none (and I can only read it in translation, alas!).  It might not be for everyone, but I've already read this book twice and it was sublime.

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Amazon Customer	4.0	2002年2月15日 在美国审核	331	All about the Monkey King, and then some	This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found. It is the third version of the story I've read, and unlike those other versions ("Adventures of Monkey King"/ISBN 0962076511 and "Monkey : A Journey to the West [ABRIDGED]"/ISBN 1570625816), it contains the complete and unabridged story, preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story. This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness. It's a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work, and you get to hear all the interesting little back-stories and side-stories that make Journey to the West one of the great works of Chinese literaure. It's a weakness because these stories often seem completely irrelevant, and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion. For example, every time something happens in Heaven, Hell or in the palace of the Tang Emperor, the book includes a complete list of everyone who attended. In Heaven, at least, many of the names are descriptive (names of stars, constellations, etc.) and are therefore translated. In the Tang Emperor's palace, though, you'll get a list of 10 or 20 names in Chinese, and only some of the names ever get stories attached to them in the book (and I challenge any non-Chinese speaker to remember the names when they do show up again). There's also a lot of poetry, and though the translations are good, translated poetry can never equal the original. In one sequence, a fisherman and a woodsman argue in verse for 10 or more pages of very small type, frequently singing songs set to tunes few non-Chinese would recognize by name. These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict, so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry. It's good poetry, to be sure, but it really can drag a bit. You can't just automatically skip over all the poems, as you might do with Tolkien, either. Elements of the story are often told in verse. You can usually skim if you're not interested in a particular bit of verse, but don't skip it entirely. The structure of the work is also surprisingly complex at times, especially given its age. It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character, and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later. You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story, but there's almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line. Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise. If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them, you'll get a second, (fortunately much abridged) version of an earlier portion of the story, written as dialog, this time. You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction, or probably just about any other country's older fiction, so this is not really a strong criticism given the work's great age, but I often found myself wishing the author (or the translator) had just written, "he told them what had happened" and left it at that. There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me. The word "memorial" was used throughout instead of "memorandum". It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on. I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout, but still didn't figure it out until I was several chapters into this one. Will all these complaints, you're probably wondering why I gave the book 4 stars. The fact is, for all its faults and quirks, "Journey to the West" is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched. The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment, while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action. It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China. If you want to get the whole story and can't read Chinese, this edition is your absolute best bet. (Indeed, it's pretty much your only bet.) Some of the other translations may be a faster read, but none are as satisfying.
13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	H. B. Baldwin	5.0	2007年5月6日 在美国审核	6	The Source of a Childhood Memory Found.	When I was younger, I saw first on TV and then later at a Kiddies Mattinee a movie "Alakazam, the Great".  If fascinated me, and as I studied more and more mythology, I realized that it must have come from a mythic source, and I tried to find that source for over 30 years.  Last Spring I found out it was part of this book by watching a made for TV movies, called "The Monkey King".  Here was the story I had been searching to find in this movie named and that is when I began to look for this book. True this book has pages that are so thin that they are like tissue, but they have beautiful illustrations and in these illustrations are the characters of Alakazam, though he is only known as Monkey here in this Chinese Buddhist tale of pilgamage, and the adventures along the way. I am used to Western Mythology, Classical, Norse, and Celtic so this was a journey that had new meaning for me.  And like the characters of this journey, it is a journey into a new and as yet source of spirituality that has much influence in the world.
13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Elbert D. Porter	4.0	2003年7月3日 在美国审核	25	an anthropological novel	I've been a long time reading this 2300-page classic Chinese "novel."  The quotes are there because, if you read it as a novel, you'll grow tired of the repetitive elements in the large body of the story.  Think of it more as a comprehensive compendium of folklore tales centering around the central character, Monkey.  The seed of the story was the actual journey of a Tang dynasty Buddhist priest from China to India and back.  This journey caught the Chinese imagination and somehow became embellished with the mythical Monkey, who ultimately became much more interesting than the priest himself.  Many stories grew around a formula of Monkey protecting the priest from monsters along the journey.  The author, Wu Cheng'en, organized many of these stories into a single narrative, which apparently became the authoritative record of all the Monkey folklore. This unabridged translation by W. J. F. Jenner includes a "Translator's Afterword," which I recommend you read before (not after) you read the story itself.  It helps you to understand why there are so many incidents that do little to develop the story or the characters.  This edition was prepared for and printed by the Foreign Language Press of Beijing, so do not expect it to meet American standards of proofreading. If you are chiefly interested in enjoying the story itself, read Arthur Waley's abridged translation, "Monkey."  He keeps all the essential elements so that you learn the plot and get to know the characters, but cuts out most of the formulaic "Monkey vs. monster" stories, so it is paced more like a modern novel.
13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Dragoneer	5.0	2011年7月30日 在美国审核	3	Hardback edition	I bought the paperback edition several years ago. I loved the myths and read the material several times. Unfortunately, the paperbacks are poorly printed and not bound well enough for multiple readings. I just received the hardbacks and make the following observations: 1) left-hand pages are printed in Chinese while right-hand pages are printed in English, 2) pictures are on single pages with the facing pages blank, 3) binding seems to be very well done - strong as well as supple, and 4) there is a bookmark ribbon attached to the binding side of each volume. In summary, this looks like a quality edition. The hardback is printed in 6 volumes while the paperback (English only) is done in 3. I assume that the translation in the hardback is the same as in the paperback version. That was done very well and I'm looking froward to rereading the adventure with quality paper in my hands; that's one of the real luxuries in life! I have, above, made several assumptions based on my prior experience with the paperback. If these assumptions prove wrong, I will update this review and my rating. This is in addition to my original review: I am now reading Volume 4 of 6. There is a horrible error in that volume. There are many missing pages from Volume 4; in their place are many pages from Volume 2. I am knocking two stars off the rating because of this. The vendor said he will send me a proper Volume 4 in October when his stock is replenished. I, fortunately, can finish reading the story because I have the paperback version from the same translator. If I receive a valid copy of Volume 4, I will re-rate upwards and assume there was just a bad run. I also note at this time that there are many little typos: wrong one of to, two, too; many one-letter substitutions; etc. I am of the opinion that the final edit of a translation should always be made by a native speaker of the "to" language. I'm guessing that this opinion was not respected here. The errors in the paperback version, if memory serves me correctly are different. This is a second update to my review: I have just received a corrected copy of Vol. 4 from the seller. Thus, I assume that good copies of this book set are available. I would caution you to check with your seller of choice that the hard copy set you order is one that does not contain the mistakes that were in my original order. At this point I'm changing my product rating back to 5 stars.

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Romer Fan	4.0	2011年1月2日 在美国审核	1	Epic, fanciful and moderately schizophrenic	If you want to test the waters before jumping into the deep end, may I suggest that you first watch the Sci-Fi Channel mini-series "The Lost Empire" (2001), originally aired under the title "The Monkey King". While far from a faithful adaptation, it is a very good introduction to the main characters and overall concept(the character of Sanzang aka Tripitaka being replaced by an American scholar of Chinese literature.) This is an incredibly lengthy story for anyone not prepared for what is inside. The basis for one of Asia's most beloved children's characters (Monkey), the tale is written as a series of short stories seemingly crafted with children as the target audience. Fashioned similar to western children's adventures ("1001 Arabian Nights" comes to mind), each snippet of the journey comes with lots of action and shallow motivation - often falling to greed, hunger, hubris, revenge or a simple thirst for adventure. I feel certain that these stories were kept easily accessible by many parents through the years as a means of entertaining their children. While the characters are far from anyone's idea of the heroic stereotype, their flaws also help to endear them. I don't want to give the impression that I am critical of this work or that I would discourage anyone from reading it, only that this may not be the right choice for your first foray into Chinese literature. Many adults in Asia will unashamedly admit to having read the full volumes (I once spent a couple of hours discussing favorite stories and swapping character impersonations with the CEO of a large company in China during a business dinner) but western readers will likely find it disjointed and often hard to follow. Though rarely pivotal to the story and generally addressed in the generous notes, the author has a great propensity for injecting phrases and concepts that the casual reader will simply not be familiar with. I often found myself running to Google in the middle of a paragraph. There is also the tendency for characters to be referred to by multiple names or titles (Monkey has more than seven) with no easy way to keep them straight. All things considered, I tend to view "Journey to the West" less as entertainment than as one small facet of the cultural legacy of China.

They are so rare, in fact, I remember their titles well.  Carlos Castenda's books, for example, and his stories about don Juan.  Journey to the West falls into this category.  Each time I resume reading it, I catch myself with a smile on my face; yes, I am enjoying the story.  And I hate to put it down when life calls me to duty.  I already know I am going to hate it when I come to the last sentence of the last volume in this set.  Perhaps fate will spare me and I will die before I reach the last sentence of the last volume; at least, I can say I died happy!  Now, it may be true that other translations of this story are better, and I am starting to mull over that notion; still, I, for one, willl not tell you this particular translation is bad; no, no, no, that will never be my pronouncement.  I encourage any doubters who may be thinking about it:  yes, buy the set and enjoy it.  You will not be sorry.

Its concise and easy to follow. I'm not sure about how accurate the translation is (I can't read Mandarin). However, the one thing that really makes me angry, is the numerous silly spelling errors throughout the book. Its as if no one bothered to edit it (there are one or two errors per chapter). There is even a spelling error in the summary at the back of the book (they used 'isa' instead of 'is a'). The paper and print quality is below average. The book is damaged and creased easily. Although the story is great and the translation is good, the book is presented in a haphazard manner.

But this exact translation is a little outdated. You would have a much better read with the newer Alex Yu translations. Also you lose a few stars for labeling this product as "a novel in 4 volumes" and not "volume 4 of 4". Nowhere on the order page did it make it clear and obvious I was buying jut the 4th volume.

Jenner	nathaniel	2.0	2018年7月13日 在美国审核	0	Outrageously long and drawn out	While there are definitely some interesting stories interspersed throughout, the major takeaway I had from this book was how LONG and BORING the adventure was. Once the main characters are established, they have encounter after encounter with trouble which inevitably goes as follows: 1) Monster sees Tang priest 2) Monster kidnaps Tang priest 3) Monkey saves the day It is in fact so formulaic that after having finished just the first (out of four!) book, there is nothing truly surprising anymore. I get that the whole journey is supposed to be epic and that the true length of their adventure must be shown, but just because the Priest and his disciples are tired from the journey doesn't mean we have to be! Yes there is character development and exciting battles along the way, but do you need 2500+ pages for it? Absolutely Not! For all those looking to get into the story I strongly suggest a more condensed version.

It helps to already know something about the religion.  As a bonus, the box has a nifty color picture of the Tang monk, and the book covers have nice color pictures of Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand. The adventures are a bit repetitious, but a hoot--Monkey is the ultimate fearless deal-maker, ready to fight on his own or call in favors to get the job done.

(Editorial Note: I realize it sounds incredibly pretentious to speak on the translation, given that I can't read the original Chinese. As a disclaimer, let me say that the most important aspects of translation for me are interest and readability. I couldn't care less about the "accuracy", or "tone of the original work," etc.). Perhaps I want something different from a translation than most. While many scholars want the reader to see the flavor of the Chinese original, I want the work to stand on its own in my language. I don't want to have to learn Chinese in order to appreciate the work. With these thoughts in mind, I am disappointed in Jenner's translation of "Journey to the West". I am no scholar. While I have read a few works here and there, the reading was solely for my amusement. To be sure, some of the works of ancient Chinese literature have truly moved me (I have read "Three Kingdoms" four times, straight through, and have perused it uncountably often). I challenge any reader to find a better adventure tale than Shapiro's retelling of "Outlaws of the Marsh", and "The Scholars" has an immediacy even in today's world. However, while the saga of the Monkey King can be at times engaging, I often lose focus sifting through the religious imagery and boring poetry (yes, I suppose it is very good, but most of these poems sound the same, so that in the end, every poetic retelling of a battle or a landscape might as well be the first). I think that the elements of a TREMENDOUS story are present (indeed, Monkey is a household name among Asian children, even today), but few children or adults can suffer through the tedium of passages such as "Most benevelont and merciful Boddhisattva" or "Enlightened Teacher of the Way and Most Compassionate Buddha" over and over. Call me sacreligious, but this is too much. I wish that Jenner's work more resembled Shapiro's, where poetry is often translated as prose or deleted altogether, so as NOT to give away the plot of an entire chapter. Five stars to the work, one to the translation for an average of three altogether.

This rating has strictly to do with the thin paper used to create the book and not the actual content of the book.  I had issues with the very thin paper the book was printed on.  So thin that the opposite side of the page 'bled through' to the page I was reading and made it appear blurry, which gave me a near instant headache, so I was unable to proceed.  I really wanted to read this book based on a friend's recommendation, and all the positive reviews it got here, but the blurriness made it impossible .  Will try again from a different publisher.

The book was good but I thought that the spirit and demon stories are too much the same over and over.  Especially when the author translate the  phrase "the two fought for so many rounds and neither seem to emerge to a victory." every time Monkey King fights the demons.  Believe me, it gets old. And Tang priest is made out to be so wimpy, crying all of the times he's caught by the demons.  I know he's supposed to be a mortal man, but, common!  crying like a baby whenever he's caught? Another thing, why hasn't the Tang priest trust Monkey King's judgement on knowing when they meet spirits and demons?  They have been traveling together for like ten years or so. I had to skip a lot because got tired of reading the same type of monsters capturing them and what Monkey King has to go thru to save them.

Jenner's version makes compelling reading and I found it very difficult to put the book down.  The translation is sprightly and idiomatic and the extensive passages in verse are attractively rendered. The only demerits are the lack of footnotes to explain some of the references to individuals and doctrines (for which one needs Yu's version) and the relatively poor standard of printing and typography: better proof-reading would have helped!  However, I cannot say that these shortcomings impaired my enjoyment of these volumes and I would strongly recommend them to anyone in search of a readable version of this engrossing epic.

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Luke	4.0	2006年5月20日 在美国审核	324	Comparing two translations of "Journey to the West"	There are, at present, two complete versions of the long Chinese comic novel "Journey to the West".  One of them, the more recent, is published by Anthony Yu at Chicago University Press.  The other, an older version made by W. J. F. Brenner for the Foreign Language Press, is made over five decades ago, but is as yet still not completely superseded. Looking through the translations, it's obvious that both are worthy undertakings by two enthusiatic contemporary Sinologists.  Anthony Yu, though not a native English speaker, is professor of East Asian studies at the Chicago University, an expert in his field, and an ethnic Chinese.  Brenner is a long-time Sino translator who has rendered his fair share of Chinese classics into English.  So how did these two translations fare compared with each other? Brenner is a no-nonsensical and very sensible translator of the Wu Cheng'en's book.  While he doesn't take great liberties with the text, when required, he demonstrates lots of felicities in reframing Chinese ideas and philosophies into English. Take the beginning for instance, a difficult passage which involves understanding of Chinese arithmetics and metaphysics.  Here is Brenner's version: "In the arithmetic of the universe, 129,600 years make one cycle. Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII. VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the twelve branches. Each phase lasts 10,800 years. "Now within a single day, the positive begins at the time I; at II the cock crows; at III it is not quite light; at IV the sun rises; V is after breakfast; and at VI one does business. VII is when the sun reaches noon; at VIII it is slipping towards the west; IX is late afternoon; the sun sets at X; XI is dusk; and at XII people settle down for the night." This is elegant as is readable and comprehensible to an English audience.  Although Brenner forgoes the nitty-gritties of exact transliteration, he did not excise anything of note, and got the gist of the passage right.  One could imagine this is how the author would have composed in English. Brenner's translation is consistently fine and accurate.  His language is on the whole simple and easily understood as long you have a high school degree.  Where Brenner is more limited, as compared to Arthur Waley's classic abridged "Monkey", is in recreating the full range of tones and satiric emotions of the original.  "Journey to the West" is a satirical, high-spirited adventure story; Brenner is idiomatic and readable, but he can occasionally sacrifice some of the original's comic mischievousness.  Here Waley is incomparable; though he may sound a little arch, one has no doubt Waley is at one with Wu Cheng'en's spirit.  Brenner, on the other hand, can at times sound a little too matter-of-factly.  There are moments where you will chuckle in delight reading Waley, but might not do so with Brenner. Now to Anthony Yu's version.  Made in the 1980s, it, too, is a highly commendable piece of work.  The first thing one notices about it is its extreme faithfulness to the text - even more so than Brenner's.  At times, it even strikes one as being slavish.  One must praise his version for being so strictly straightforward, though at times this literalmindedness makes some word choices incomprehensible to English readers.  Take his constant rendition of "Wood Mother" for instance, a term which has no meaning whatsoever in English, or "eating rice" for "taking a meal".  This is a version especially good if you know your Chinese and would like a crib to read the original with.  While maybe not as idiomatic as Brenner, Yu is even more academic and scholarly in that he attempts to translate every character of the language.  Faithfulness to the letter of the text takes foremost priority, sometimes over readibility. The success rate is varying, but the translation is on the whole an admirable one. Comparing the two, both Yu and Brenner can be recommended.  Yu would be first choice if fidelity to the text is your priority.  If you prefer your English to be more idiomatic and the story to flow better, Brenner should be considered.  The two run pretty close and neither is yards ahead of the other.  But Waley's translation is still a marvellous read, and even if it is highly abridged, it should under no circumstances be forgotten.

Full of important allegory. For example, if you find yourself in the company of a pig, a monkey, and a horse, do you really think you can stay out of trouble? Or will the pig, the horse, and the monkey redeem themselves by saving your bacon? And can you really get where you are going without them? Or should you choose a different destination and leave the pig, the monkey, and the horse where you found them? You can see that it gets really interesting. We all go through life with this barnyard coterie of associates, and what we think of them and how well we collaborate is of the utmost importance, so that is what I am thinking as I reflect on this very interesting, not to mention fun, book.

At over 3,000 pages across four volumes, it's quite a journey in and of itself. I will examine plot, characters and polish before assigning a grade.  This is a review of the novel as a whole. I might do something more specific at a later date.  PLOT  The novel itself is basically two stories. First is the Rise and Fall of the Monkey King and the second is Xuanzang's journey to fetch scriptures from Thunder Monastery.  The Rise and Fall of Monkey is like a Protagonists Journey to Villain. It starts off with Stone Monkey becoming the Handsome Monkey King and going on adventures to protect his kingdom from threats, up to and including death-by-old-age. Then he gets so full of himself he attacks gods and rebels against heaven. In the end this villain is defeated.  The plot is quick, fast paced and constantly escalates. The method by which Monkey becomes so powerful makes sense. The series of events that lead to him trapped under Five Elements Mountain is driven by character decisions. It can stand alone as a complete story. Naturally, Monkey fans want to see him get out from under that rock but it can stand alone.  The rest of the novel is Xuanzang's journey to fetch scriptures. It has an interesting start. There's this Dante's Inferno thing as part of the set up and there's also how Xuanzang gets involved in the quest and then how he recruits his three disciples. Then it's basically filler until they reach Thunder Monastery.  The Pilgrims encounter demons that want to eat/seduce Xuanzang and Monkey has to rescue him. Usually, he has to seek help from other deities instead of simply smashing everything in his path. There's occasional variations, like helping a kingdom from an unrelated demon scheme, problems with humans, or a Broken Bridge.  I like the ending. It's a good ending, with closure and such.  CHARACTERS  Because there is No Antagonist, the only developed main characters here are the pilgrims themselves.  Xuanzang is basically a walking plot device because he takes no action other than starting the journey and placing the headband on Monkey's head. Monkey could jump back and forth between Thunder Monastery and Tang capital twenty times with ease but Xuanzang is mortal and cannot ride on clouds so he has to go the long and hard way. He gets captured to involve the Pilgrims in the affairs of demons along the way and insists on helping everyone (even if they're a demon in disguise), thus providing the excuse to delay the Journey.  If the other three characters in your cast are criminal demons, then it's necessary to have somebody like this but he could stand to be more like a true Good Shepherd and less like a jerkass.  Monkey is like a Trope Maker or something for general shonen anime heroes: he's rude, arrogant, and defeats enemies by beating them senseless with his superior martial arts but he is also driven by a kind heart that wants to protect his subjects. In addition, he is an old and cunning trickster. Many of his victories rely on sneaking around gathering Intel and then devising a strategy to overcome his opponent's advantages. He also knows more about Buddhist teachings than his own master, who was raised a Buddhist monk.  Pig is basically a sidekick type character. He makes wisecracks, helps the hero in small ways, and gets captured occasionally.  There isn't much to say about Friar Sand (or the dragon prince/horse for that matter).  POLISH  When you're translating over 3,000 pages of Chinese into English, there's bound to be some typos. I only found a couple, which is admirable on the part of the translator.  Trickster Eric Novels gives Journey to the West a B+

The author uses split-character method to create 4 main characters: Master, Monkey, Pig and Sandy. that actually one person that holds all these character on a struggling road for good. Master fears, Monkey dares, Pig lusts, Sandy dumb, of course each one holds more related natures not to mention, I hate many critics state that Sandy is not fully developed, that's exactly such person, that we may find him at our work place and in government office too. And another things, a reader may find out that those road blocks, demons and monsters are actually closely related to many gods, sages, and even Buddhas' their family, servants, or weaponary or item which their belongings that cause all the troubles for the 4 and the common people on earth. True, Wu Kong wants to be great, he is great; San Zang wants to get all wisdom scroll for his nation (people), even the gods support them, but who are truly blocking them to do so? This is not only satire to religion and government, it reaches deeper and much farther than To the West. It is a journey or reflection that author carries us to experience and each reflection after beating away a demon, and at last even Buddha calls a storm to sink some of their scrolls. Just look around company, society, government, or even religious institute, or any institute, as long as one who recognizes himself in it and strives for good, then he may obtain the experience and nature of the 4 main characters, and he would also discover all the gods and demons: jade emperor, Guan Yi, White Bone Fairy.... Welcome the Journey to the West, it's better than Disney world, coz this mythical world is 100% real :-)

Jenner	Devlin	5.0	2001年2月22日 在美国审核	116	Wacky hijinks and humorous monkey business	Journey to the West is probably the most well-known tale amongst Chinese folk the world over.  It is a story that has been adapted in the form of operas, television series, cartoons and movies many times over.  To be able to read a complete and unabridged version of this epic is a joy indeed.  My only regret is that as a Western-educated Chinese, I am not able to read this masterpiece in it's original language.  Although the translator does a very good job at translating the book, I am sure many nuances and subtleties of the Chinese language have been lost in the translation. The story is a simple one.  Set during the early Tang dynasty (the peak of Chinese civilisation), a holy Buddhist monk has to travel from China to India to collect the true Mahayana Buddhist scriptures from the Lord Buddha himself, in order to bring enlightenment to his fellow country men.  The journey is a long and ardous one, not least because numerous demons lie waiting in ambush for a chance to capture and eat the monk, as his holy body will confer immortality on whoever eats it.  Thus, the Goddess of Compassion assembles a strange group of bodyguards for the monk: the proud and mischievous Monkey, the lustful and greedy Pig, the loyal and steadfast Friar Sand, and a Dragon Prince transformed into a horse.  Their various adventures are so full of humor and wacky hijinks that I cannot help myself from laughing out from time to time.  Monkey is the ultimate Chinese version of the universal trickster-hero.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this book.  You will not regret it for a moment.
13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Chief Slapaho	3.0	2012年2月28日 在美国审核	1	Terrific story, but we are punished for reading this in English.	I should point out that I am just a product of the American public education system who only knows english. I read this in my free time and knew little to to nothing of Chinese history. Somethings, I feel, are definately lost in translation here. I understand that much of the Poetry is layed out in beautiful rhymes and even set to music in Mandarin or whatever dialect came first but to read these parts translated quite so literaly into english is as painful as it is reduntant. I tried to skip some of it but once in a while, there is one tiny detail that you have to catch in the poetry explanations that are integral to the overal story of a given chapter. In that respect, we pay a culture penalty for reading this in english, no matter how skillfully this book was translated. The origion chapters for the main characters where a thrill ride and every bit worth the cost of the book. After you have established the characters and their origion stories and they set off on their, well.. "Journey to the West", some of the monster stories start to follow simular patterns. The middle to end parts of this book may have made for an entertaining tv series. Every chapter there was always some kind of monster trying to eat the Tang Priest guy that Monkey and company where escourting. If it wasn't scary monster animal/demon spirits trying to eat the Monk to gain immortality, it was some female monster/animal/demon spirit trying to have sex with the Tang priest to gain immortality because he was an 8th generation reincarnated virgin saint or something. These stories are intermitten with other chapters that had to do with them taking a detour or having to deal with someone from Monkey's past or some monsters trying to mess with our hero's for whatever reason. There are alot of crossover cameos from other numerous Chinese and Indian storys and mythologies. To that end, it has sort of a Shrek 2 vibe to it. This book is an epic, every bit as worthy, if not more so, than the likes of the Illiad or The Lord of the Rings. This also reads like a comic book that hasn't been fully illistrated yet. Nobody tell Frank Miller. The battle scenes go on for several pages at times. If thats your thing, there you go. If you don't mind skimming through a dab of gibberish here or there to get to a great story, this book is for you. Fair warning, you may not get through it in one sitting, It did run over 2000 pages.

I think that the translation is not too bad (given its history), and it would be fun to read aloud.  I like how the books are divided, and the illustrations from the Qing dynasty are also fascinating.  As for the content, I think it is probably widely known among people who study Chinese culture.  The most lovable character is obviously Monkey, who will stop at nothing to protect his feeble Buddhist master the Tang priest Sanzang.  Zhu the pig is also interesting as an incessantly loathsome character who specializes in overeating and over-indulging in just about everything.  The only character I think could have been more developed was Friar Sand.. :(.  The most predictable one was Quan Yin who always ends up saving Monkey for the first two books.  Some great moments were: the manfruit, the false Western Heaven, and of course Monkey's bad behavior in the first 20 chapters of the book.  Its a great read for any age.
13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Zoner	5.0	2005年7月21日 在美国审核	39	There was once a magic stone ....	I've always loved books, particularly the kind that create a new and different world and draw you into it. It seems I was pretty serious about my fantasy reading, as evidenced by an inscription to my children in the back of The Fellowship of The Ring, mass market paperback edition circa 1977. I wrote the inscription with a ball-point pen when I was 10. My daughter showed it to me when she was 14 or so. It said something to the effect that I love this book so much that my only wish is to pass it on to my kids so that they can feel what I did when I first read it. Apparently I did, and apparently they did. I still feel that way about The Lord of The Rings, but I read Journey To The West a couple of years ago, and it made me feel the same way except magnified. I was 37 when I first read it. It was like Tolkien, plus all the L. Frank Baum Oz books plus the Arabian Nights, all the Greek myths, Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams all rolled into one. This book is over 2300 pages, so it took some discipline to get through. But as you go, you savor each moment, each line. When I turned the final page, I was seriously tempted to start again at the beginning. Seriously, it's that good. It is that good, despite being very far out of context for most people like me. What I mean is, I'm about as Western as you can get, or at least my parents intended me to be so. My understanding is that Chinese kids absorb the Monkey King story by osmosis, they drink it like mother's milk from they day they are born .... kind of like Big Bird or Elmo in the west. But that's not at all a fair comparison. Big Bird and Elmo fall in the category of pop culture. This same category is fair game for any number of PhD theses in any number of fields of learning. Do you reckon anyone will know who Elmo is 500 years from now? Neither do I. But we still know Monkey today, and I bet we will still know him 500 years from now, if there is anyone around to know anything. It is possible that Journey to the West is the most widely read or known text in the history of humanity. That's a bizarre thought to those of us brought up in the isolated shelter of Judeo-Christian mythology. I'm sure it is less analyzed than the Christian bible, but then it doesn't exactly beg for analysis: it's obviously a very long fable, indicating very little in the way of how to live one's life, whether or not to eat bacon with tea on a Tuesday morning, or anything else relevant to modern life. It's not about textbook ethics, nor is it about everyday morality. It's not about how to please God or your fellow man (woman if you are one, to quote Colin Hay). It's about fantasy. It's about delight in the sheer variety of the world around. If I were a book, I would want to be about that. All that is left is for me to suggest that you read Monkey King. It's a project, and you need to get in the right frame of mind. You're going to need some fortitude to read it all, but it's worth it. It really is worth it. What follows is my somewhat lame attempt to summarize a book which probably shouldn't be summarized. Please ignore it, I wrote it in a fit of passion 2 years ago. Sun Wukong is the Handsome Monkey King, Great Sage Equaling Heaven. This book is about Sun Wukong, the Monkey. The novel is composed of 100 chapters, each told as a story such as an oral storyteller might relate. Each chapter ends with a sort of cliffhanger and a directive to read on if you want to know what happens next. In chapter 1 Monkey is born (hatched ?!) and asserts himself as a force to be reckoned with. He's fairly happy eating exotic fruits and being king of the mountain but eventually the idea of death occurs to him, and he gets quite naturally upset. One of his monkey friends suggests to him that there are 3 kinds of beings who are free from the cycle of death and rebirth: Buddhas, Immortals, and Sages. The Immortals are enlightened ones of the Taoist faith, and Sages refers to Confucianism. The Handsome Monkey King decides to set out on a journey to gain immortality. Eventually (after about 10 years have passed) he runs into a Taoist Immortal who imparts the secrets of everlasting life and great travel powers to him. Having acquired great cosmic powers, Monkey proceeds to use them. He causes no end of distress to the kings of Hell in Chapter 3, and soon comes to the attention of Heaven (i.e. the Powers That Be). Heaven attempts to placate Monkey's insatiable lust for power and recognition with a fake job and title. Monkey can be fooled, but only for so long, and in the end he causes chaos in Heaven (which is a bad thing). The Jade Emperor of Heaven calls out all the armies of demons, heavenly generals and warriors, you name it. Time after time they try to take Monkey into custody and fail, until finally the Buddha himself steps in and traps Monkey. Handsome Monkey King is imprisoned under a mountain for some 500 years. By now we're up to chapter 8, in which the Bodhisattva Guanyin sets out on a journey to appoint a pure hearted priest to go west and bring back the scrolls of wisdom from the Buddha's Western Paradise. On the way Guanyin flags a couple of demons to help the priest on his journey. In chapters 9 through 12 we learn about Sanzang, the Tang Priest who is destined to recover the scriptures from the West, a million miles away, or so it seems. Sanzang is a rather weak fellow, a mere mortal with no special powers of any kind. His strength is the pureness of his heart and his faith in his mission. The Journey to the West is Sanzang's voyage to recover the scrolls, and it really begins in chapter 13. He does not have an easy time of it, being almost constantly beset by tigers, monsters and demons, not to mention deep dark forests and formidable mountain ranges. However the Tang Priest quickly gets help, in the form of a dragon transformed into a horse, a flesh eating demon who works as a bodyguard and gopher, and a gluttonous moronic pig-demon who serves nicely as a luggage carrier. But most importantly he acquires Monkey, who is freed from his imprisonment under the mountain on the condition that he helps the Tang Priest and cultivates his behavior, learning to be a good Buddhist monk. Imagine Monkey with a shaved head. Once the cast is assembled, the journey begins in earnest. Monkey, the Idiot (Pig), Sandy and the dragon horse accompany Sanzang through 30000 miles of dangerous terrain, beset by evil spirits and demons at every turn. By this time we're done with chapter 25, 585 pages into the novel, and we've closed the back cover of Volume 1. In the other hand we hold Volume 2, almost drooling with anticipation. Throughout the next 75 chapters, the action is pretty much non-stop. There are lots of bad guys, and Monkey gets lots of chances to show off his incredible magical powers, his sheer brute force, and his amazing mental capacity. His conversations and arguments with The Tang Priest and The Idiot are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. His martial prowess, wielding the As-You-Will Iron Cudgel, is unparalleled. Sometimes even Monkey gets in over his head and has to call in an air strike in the form of Heavenly forces, or various Gods, Constellations, or other muscle. I won't give away the ending, but suffice it to say it's a happy one, after 2317 pages. As to the quality of the translation I have nothing to add. It was more than readable to me: it was a delight, poetry and all. As to the quality of the editing, it's not perfect. On the other hand, the flaws don't detract from the experience at all. As to the quality of the printing: keep in mind that this is published by Foreign Language Press of Beijing. In some ways FLP doesn't live up to American standards of production quality, but in others it excels them. The paper is necessarily thin, but the books are tightly bound. These are not mass-market paperbacks. One does not feel that the books will fall apart on a second reading, and there is very little danger of breaking the spine. Also, Journey to the West is nicely illustrated with Qing Dynasty pictures. The quality of the reproductions is not the highest, but let's not bite the hand that feeds us. My box of Journey to the West was a bit scuffed and dinged and dented. Same with the other titles I have purchased from FLP through Amazon. I imagine this is FLP's fault. I'm not entirely happy about it but for a book this great, I can live with a couple of small physical flaws (especially at this price). I'm just happy I got my grubby little monkey paws on it.

Jenner	Sylvester	5.0	2006年8月7日 在美国审核	18	A "Journey" that Is More Than Just Fighting Demons and Magical Spectacles	JOURNEY TO THE WEST," IS A CELEBRATED CLASSIC WRITTEN ABOUT FIVE CENTURIES AGO BY WU CHENG'EN, AKA MASTER OF SHEYANG, ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO THE WEST TO FETCH THE SUTRA, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS a story of every person's purpose in life, to live a righteous life, go on the road he or she must go, until he or she reaches the Western Paradise. This person, represented by a team of the Tang Priest and his four disciples, has personalities like each of them. We may not know it, but we have an ounce of cleverness and bravery and strength in each and every one of us, like Monkey King, and are we not as stupid, lazy, and lascivious as Pig? Like Frair Sand, we can be steadfast to our beliefs, what is right, and can tell what is man and what is demon, what is right and what is wrong? The horse is repentant of his crime and accepted his converted life as a horse, are we  not like that too? The Tang Priest represents everything that is pure and right, but is a gullible person. The demons they met on their way represent different sins and temptations, to fight them is a battle within oneself, fighting for what is right and against what is wrong. At last, when all battles against evil are won, they are pure and righteous and changed over the course of the journey, worthy to meet Buddha, get the Sutras, and become Buddhas themselves. This simple story is lesser known as a religious story, but is still highly recommended by me, because of its exciting plot, great characters,a reflection of Chinese feudalism and society of the time Wu Cheng'en lived, teachings of Buddhism, and knowing a thing or two about Chinese culture, all packaged in one. A true classic!

The Chinese love their bureaucracy. Numbers are very important and interesting to them as are titles and position. Translating all the boring bits does not make for a good read, but it does make for an excellent insight into Chinese culture, not on a mythological level (the rest of the novel does a great job of that) but on the day to day level and how government affects their day to day life. To that end, it's a very good translation. A bit boring at times, if you're not one for too much detail that bears little relevance to the plot. Characters are named with grand titles but never appear again, while minor characters will receive fully fleshed out back stories that seem tangential to the original story but soon tie neatly in. A very good set of books. Interesting, boring at times, but as pure as it can be to the source material without learning one of the most difficult languages in the world. Also, this is the story that inspired Monkey Magic and Dragon Ball. If you're fan of either, it's a good read just out of curiosity.

It was called "Monkey" and the premise was that three spirits had been banished to Earth, to regain entry to Heaven they had to take sacred writings to the West travelling with a priest. Now I loved this programme for several reasons, 1. the stories were wonderful 2. it had great action sequences 3. the acting was hilarious 4. it had a funky seventies disco/cheese soundtrack. So little did I suspect that the story was an ancient tale by Cheng'en Wu - it took a friend from Japan to point it out. Re-living my wasted youth - I ordered instantly from Amazon and have not been disappointed - these stories are wonderful and perfectly mixed my childhood afternoon TV sessions after school with my 30 year old mind and spirituality. I still love Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy - and I suspect you will too!

It's a fun novel, besides, folklore collections and ancient Chinese fiction, presenting a real world through imaginary stories. You will encounter demons (sometimes, god-like ones), gods (sometimes, common people-like ones) and common people... I don't know about others, but I found myself in this book: sometimes I am the priest, sometimes I am the pig and sometimes I am the monkey... PS: It's one of the so called "4 Chinese ancient classics" (other 3 are A Dream of Red Mansions, Outlaws of the Marsh and Three Kingdoms)

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Alex	2.0	2010年11月18日 在美国审核	9	Not For The Average Reader	Though "Journey to the West" is immeasurably important in the history of fiction, I find it hard to recommend it in its entirety. Sure, the story itself is a classic, but it, for the most part, is also incredibly dull, repetitive, and downright confusing as an actual novel. For instance, the story begins with a longwinded explanation of how the Kalpa system works. Fine, that's pretty interesting. This serves as a transition into the actual story, which begins like so: "There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirty'six feet five inches high and twenty'four feet round. It was thirty'six feet five inches high to correspond with the 365 degrees of the heavens, and twenty'four feet round to match the twenty'four divisions of the solar calendar. On top of it were nine apertures and eight holes, for the Nine Palaces and the Eight Trigrams." Okay, we get it. There was a rock on a mountain. Moving on... "There were no trees around it to give shade, but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides. Ever since Creation began it had been receiving the truth of Heaven, the beauty of Earth, the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon; and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers. It developed a magic womb, which burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball. When the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey." Wait, what? How? Back it up a second! Hey! "When the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk, he bowed to each of the four quarters. As his eyes moved, two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace." Huh?! Why?! I assumed that the monkey's origin was in line with the mythical creator Pan Gu's, given the similarities, but after page one, it's never acknowledged. We never learn why the rock changes into a monkey of anything in the universe it could've been. And the light thing? No hint of reason is given, it just happens. There are plenty of moments like this. Bizarre, mystical mumbo jumbo that's never explained. I've asked fans and scholars alike about this scene, and to this day, there is no explanation of what the hell it's supposed to mean. Oh, and the poetry... ugh. Every few paragraphs, the story suddenly grinds to a halt so that the narrator can expound an awkwardly translated poem. Usually, these serve to replace the conventional act of conveniently describing something. Usually, this means pointing out every intricate detail of a character's outfit or a plot of land for no real reason. Maybe it sounds wonderful in its original Chinese, but the translations I've read are all cringe-worthy. Here's an example, also from the first few pages. This one describes a feast: "Golden pills and pearl pellets, Bursting red and plump yellow. The golden pills and pearl pellets were winter cherries, beautiful and sweet; The bursting red and plump yellow were ripe plums, tasty and sharp. Fresh, sweet'fleshed longans with thin skins. Fiery lichees with tiny stones in a red sack. Branch after branch of crab'apples, Yellow'skinned loquats with their leaves on. Rabbit'head pears and chicken'heart jujubes To quench your thirst, remove your cares, and sober you up. Fragrant peaches and tender apricots, As sweet and luscious as jade wine." This goes on for a page and a half. I think that just about explains it.  That said, this novel has a major upside: the actual story of the first seven chapters. Though it's largely considered a prologue by purists (most of whom just Wikipedia summaries of chapter eight and up) the wild adventure of Sun Wukong the monkey king, which I'll call Part One for convenience's sake, is the only part anyone really cares about. Poetry and lackluster prose aside, Part One is one big swashbuckling adventure, following Wukong's rise to power and war against Heaven. It's colorful, epic, and the only section that follows a consistant plot. It also contains some of the most famous moments in Chinese fiction, including Wukong's training (the basis for Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back), the Buddha's Palm scene, and one incredible chase sequence that really knocked me off my feet. When Part One wraps up, though, everything goes downhill.  The actual journey westward sees a main character switch and a change in format. The alleged meat-and-potatoes of the novel follows a monk named Xuanzang as he and his four desciples, including Wukong, as they travel to India to acquire a set of scriptures. This section takes from Chapter 8 to 97, and between those points, there is no concept of coherence or character development. It's entirely episodic and formulaic to a point where you can skip 95% of it and nothing will have moved forward. Most of these episodes consist of Xuanzang being kidnapped by a monster-of-the-week and Wukong saving him while their comrades contribute little to nothing at all. It gets old fast, and the overly direct translations don't help at all.  There is very little reason to keep reading after Part One. Some of the demons during the main quest are fun, I very much like the main party, even if none of them develop at all during the course of the story, but there isn't much to go on once Sun Wukong steps out of the limelight in Chapter 8. Instead, I recommend a few alternatives.  -The kid's TV series that aired on the BBC in the 80's, called "Monkey". It's pure, hyperactive, campy fun.  -The Chinese animated film "Havoc in Heaven" is a beautiful rendering of Part One only.  -Arthur Waley's famous abridged version, also called "Monkey" cuts out most of the repitition and all of the poetry. It's snappy, whimsical, and much better paced than the massive original.

Jenner	Cicada	4.0	2006年10月2日 在美国审核	6	this book reads like water. . . . .	although a great book, somewhat marred by a less than perfect translation (although let's give credit where credit is due, i would not have liked to edit this book) - this book reads somewhat like water.  about two thousand pages of the narrative deals with the journey of Priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand as they travel westward in search of the scriptures of the "Greater Vehicle" - the other three hundred pages deals with the birth of the Monkey King and his rebellion in heaven at the start of the book, and the end where they finally reach the Thunder Monastary on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven a.k.a. Tibet. pretty much the rest of the book deals with the trials and tribulations that these four monks (only three of which are fully developed characters: poor Friar Sand is left as the fifth wheel most of the time) go through in trying to 'fetch' these scriptures for the enlightenment of all humanity.  the priest is a real ding-dong, he's constantly getting himself into all sorts of trouble, and he never heeds the Monkey King's advice about anything, so the Priest is always falling into the jaws of some new monster on virtually every chapter.  the Pig is no better, as he would sooner run into trouble or create trouble for everyone else for the sake of either his pride or his stomach.  the Monkey King is the real hero of this book, as he is constantly rescuing everyone from some sort of demon or tempting succubus around practically every corner.  and what of Friar Sand? . . . well, he is just kind of there to guide the Priest's horse. this book is definitely worth a read though, i thoroughly enjoyed it, despite its short comings.  the incessant poetry gets kind of annoying though, most of it is relevant to the "plot" so you can't really skip too much of it.  i give it four stars.

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Bibliophile	5.0	2002年9月24日 在美国审核	4	Best Loved Fantasy Novel for a Fifth of Mankind	Imagine "The Lord of the Rings" doubling its length, complexity of plots, the number of characters, monsters, spirits, and other beings of all kinds - then you get the idea of just what a monumental book this is.  It's like an encyclopedia written in the form of a novel!  It's also the most famous fanatasy fiction in the Chinese-speaking world.  Now that's a big deal. The Buddhist monk's mission is to walk all the way from the Chinese capital to India, a distance of at least 2000 miles.  By contrast, the distance between Hobbiton and Mordor is only about 1000 miles.  While the monk's goal is to take back Buddhist books from "the West," i.e., India, Frodo's task is to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom of Mordor, i.e., in the East. The Monk is to bring back something of great importance, the Hobbit to destroy it.  The Monk is a man of great wisdom, with an absolutely pure heart, but powerless and helpless in the face of monsters.  He commands the services of his pupil the Monkey King, who has limitless supernatural powers.  Hobbit's strength lies also in his purity of heart, which however fails only at the very end.  Otherwise he is just as powerless as the Monk.  Gandalf is the man of great wisdom and a tremendous wizard who assists Frodo.  "The Journey to the West" is permeated throughout with Buddhist overtones and undertones - like blood in the human body, they are everywhere.  Tolkien's book is pagan, of course, but the distinction between good and evil is no less sharp.  All characters return home heroes. Those who've read both books (or at least seen the films adapted from them) will appreciate the complexity of the Chinese imaginative mind.  Nothing Tolkien wrote can compare.  Curiously, little is known about this author, other than the great fame of his book.

If you have seen or read the first ten episodes of the Television show or manga "Dragon Ball" created by Akira Toryama in mid '80's, you'll see a similarity. The names are a little different, but the basic story is identical. If you are a Dragon Ball fan, you'll see where I'm coming from. This extremely long story about that old Chinese legend, inspired the great Akira in writing the greatest Japanese story ever written. Mainly, because it led to Dragon Ball Z, and then finally to Dragon Ball GT which has still not appeared in English, but probably will sometime in the near future. So, I'm going to but this story and see what else Akira based his popular Dragon Ball series on...

It is an unabridged translation, therefore it is 3 books long.  But it is worth it.  Not only is it written clearly, but it keeps the style of the original, meaning that interwoven between pharagraphs of prose are poems.  This give the book a wonderful charm that the abridged, prose versions lack.  The ancient Chinese thought, such as yin and yang, Daoism, Chinese Buddhism, also give the book an authentic flavor that enriches the experience of reading this classic.  It is still the same wonderful story of the michevous Monkey King, his difficulties with the gods in heaven, and his redeeming pilgramage with the Buddhist monk/priest Sanzang to find sutras.  For anyone seriously interested in this story and who doesn't read Chinese, this is the edition for them!

It is an allegory of Buddhist doctrine, based on the real life pilgrimage of Tripitaka, a Chinese monk who traveled to India in search of religions scripture in (I believe) the seventh century.  The very descriptive text contains some of the most astoundingly beautiful poetic passages I have ever encountered.  Footnotes contain references to everthing from historical notes to daily customs of the period.  This set of books is among the most treasured in my library.

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Lindsey	4.0	2014年2月28日 在英国审核	10	A brilliant novel, not so brilliantly presented	The classic novel 'Journey to the West' is well worth a read if you like Chinese history, or enjoy studying religion, or like mythology. While parts are dry, the novel overall is really interesting and I found most of it to be very engaging. Even though Monkey is insanely overpowered, and a lot of characters are two-dimensional (like Pig), the problems of the party always present a challenge and the trouble they get into and the struggles they have to overcome are varied and don't get boring (well, most of the time anyway. It's a long story and some parts are very repetitive). While this book is rich in detail and shows the incredible and complex Chinese Buddhist mythology and traditions beautifully, it's obvious that the author had a real hatred of Taoists. If you're a scholar of Buddhism or Chinese religions, this book is definitely a must-read, but be aware of the biases. The biggest problems I had were that this set of books (the novel is split into four parts) doesn't seem to have been proofread against typos and also seems to have been printed on quite low-quality paper. Also, some of the translation notes are cut off or are missing. Otherwise, this is a brilliant set of books. They're well worth the price.

It has exceeded my expectations.  I would certainly recommend to anyone who wants to have an understanding of a famous Chinese folklore.  In fact, many Chinese today who practise traditional Chinese ancestor worship pray to the Monkey God and he is revered as a deity and many Chinese temples of statues of the Monkey God.

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	Nigel Jackson	5.0	2006年10月2日 在英国审核	36	To the Western Heaven with the mind-ape Sun Wukong,	This is a lucid and superlative translation of this classic Chinese novel: Arthur Waley's abridgment 'Monkey'is great for getting the flavour of Wu Cheng'en's timeless novel but this complete translation by W.J.F Jenner, illustrated with many Ching period woodcuts, is a true delight and one at last appreciates the scope of 'Journey to the West' in all its amazing detail - it's a masterwork perhaps comparable to J.R.R Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' and the narrative is rich with weird adventures, bizarre and comedic episodes, wild combats, spiritual and poetic interludes and charged throughout with esoteric Taoist, alchemical and Buddhist symbolism as we follow the way via many vicissitudes to the Western Heaven and the Greater Vehicle scriptures with our heroes, the monk Tripitaka who is a sort of everyman on the spiritual quest through life, the irrepressible Monkey, who represents the mercurial mind so hard to control, and also the amazing magical powers of the immortal Taoist adept which nonetheless need to learn to be motivated and guided by the higher quality of Compassion and placed in the service of the enlightened Buddha-nature. Pigsy of course stands for the lower appetites and is a hilarious glutton and Friar Sand is a strange and earnest figure who defies definition. It would be a faint spirit indeed who could not take pleasure in the cunning strategems and heroic antics of the irascible Monkey King, the Great Sage Equalling Heaven - these characters are archetypal aspects of each of us and their great quest mirrors the journey of the spirit. This 3 volume translation is a joy to read and the exquisite poems which are embedded throughout really add to the full appreciation of this wonderful and intricate novel. Like 'The Golden Ass' of Apuleius it is richly humorous but beneath the phantastic episodes and the wild japes there is a serious message and purpose and the 'Journey to the West' is a profoundly spiritual novel. Was there ever a hero like the Handsome Monkey King!!

13	西游记	Journey to the West	吴承恩	W.J.F. Jenner	KGBeast	4.0	2009年7月5日 在德国审核	0	One of the World-Classics  - a bit laxily edited	This is the first half of the story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey-King, the piggy Shu Wuneng and the terrible Sha Wujing who in the Tang-time converted to Buddhism to accompaign the Tang-priest Sanzang to the Westerly Heaven - today's India - to find Buddha, show him reference and return to the country of Tang with some Scriptures. Starting with Monkey's brith and teaching up to his revolt in the Heavenly Palace and his following banishment this book tells about how the four came together and about the first half of their monsters-, demons- and other things infested journey. It is also a show and an indirect discussion of Taoism, Buddhism and Konfuzianism and how this philosophical schools have influenced each other. The story of Monkey and his comrades has often been adapted to other forms, like movies, plays, TV-serials, and comics (e.g. "Dragonball") and is starting with its creation in the 16th century certainly one of the most influential pieces of literature - even if outside of China most people have seldom heard of it. The edition in hand is quite comprehensive, but the editing is a bit sloppy, so that quite often homophones have been mixed in the final text, which makes the reading a bit strenuous in parts. For this - not for the quality of the work itself - one star has been deducted.

14	西游记	The Monkey and the Monk: An Abridgment of The Journey to the West	吴承恩	Anthony C. Yu	Christina Paige	5.0	2018年5月25日 在美国审核	14	Journey to the West condensed to one volume	This is a distillation of Yu’s faithful translation of the 100 chapter, 4-volume The Journey to the West, the part historical, part mythical epic of Chinese literature which has been the basis for numerous movies, animes. and memes.  The essential first 8 chapters of the original, which tell how Monkey becomes a force to be reckoned with, are condensed to 7; most of the trimming comes after the divine monk Tripitaka Tang sets out to bring Buddhist scriptures from India back to China, since his encounters with obstacles become a bit repetitive in the long version. The monk is actually the incarnation of a Heavenly being who volunteered to suffer human birth in order to bring the means of enlightenment to the people of the East. But once he is mortal he will lose his divine perceptions and be vulnerable to illusions, deceptions, and wrong thinking, so he is assigned 4 assistants, all of them immortals who have fallen into disgrace one way or another. (Don’t drop a teacup or set fire to Heavenly curtains, and especially don’t steal all the peaches.) Their task is to transport him safely, thereby winning their freedom to return to their former estates. This assignment is made difficult by several factors. At least two of the disciples loathe each other and are forever squabbling and fighting. Pigsy is lazy and wants to go back to eating meat and having sex; Monkey wants to go back to being King of the Flower Fruit Mountain. Only the gold fillets that act like 16th century tasers keep the unruly disciples from rebellion. Thieves and politicians bar their way. The major difficulty, however, is that every monster who wants a short cut to immortality, bypassing all that tedious self-cultivation, wants to devour the monk, for it is widely known that even one mouthful of Tripitaka’s flesh will prolong life, and making a meal of him will bestow longevity. Time and time again Monkey exerts himself on the monk’d behalf, saving Tripitaka from hungry monsters who disguise themselves as damsels in distress or feeble patriarchs, when they don’t simply capture the travelers by a frontal assault. The story is magnificent adventure, incorporating poetry, allusions to esoteric medicine and meditation practices, breathtaking descriptions of travel, ferocious fight sequences, and braggadocio exchanges between combatants. It is so refreshing to encounter a classic that isn’t inherently a tragedy based on war or lust for power, thirst for revenge. Instead, this epic centers around a quest to benefit all of creation by promoting enlightenment. In the style of the poems included in this translation, here is a summary: From a mountain stone egg is born The Mind Monkey. This one studies the Tao, Masters transformations and defeats the lords of death, Devours immortal peaches and Heavenly feasts, Challenges the divine champions, Defeating all — all but one. Only Quanyin’s intercession Frees Monkey to pursue once again The Way as a Heavenly monk’s disciple, One of four magical beings who serve and guard Tripitaka Tang on his quest for scriptures. Not always willingly. Pigsy loves earthy pleasures, Monkey resorts to violence. Over mountains and across rivers, Eluding traps and subduing demons, The five companions refine their spirits. Who will find the Way within the way?

Yu	Dani	4.0	2014年11月29日 在美国审核	35	Hilarious classic story and well-done abridgment	First off: I'm really glad this was an abridgment-- the 100-chapter, four-volume complete story sounds utterly overwhelming. I've read long books, and I've read the entire Harry Potter series multiple times, but classic books are at time more difficult to digest than modern novels. Secondly, remember that this story is hundreds of years old. Some of the story-telling styles are old-school. If you've read other ancient books and stories, you might know what I mean. It's not organized the way a modern story might be, and while it is entertaining, it had its own religious goals as well. But don't forget to enjoy the ridiculous antics the characters often take part in. This leads me to my next point: it helped me to have some background knowledge before reading this book. While the translator/editor of this book adds a few footnotes, it doesn't explain the basics. To enjoy this story more, I would recommend attaining a little background knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and ancient China. But no worries on becoming an expert! This is still an enjoyable story, at times adventurous and at times hilarious. I had to look up some things such as "what does 'kowtow' mean?" and "what are the eight trigrams?" and the like. But as I familiarized myself with this book and its contents, I began to understand some of the references to it. For example, I discovered that many animes draw on mythologies, including this story. Goku in Dragon Ball is based on the monkey of this book, as is a tailed beast in Naruto. Other references (especially in anime, but not exclusively) came not directly from this book, but from religious characters/items/stories/etc. mentioned in this book. I feel like I learned a lot both in reading this book and seeking to understand not only the story itself, but the background that goes into it.

This labor of love from Anthony Yu is an amazing translation for English readers!  In the preface Mr. Yu discusses his reasons for wanting to provide a culturally accurate translation for English readers.  Being a native speaker of Chinese and growing up in the culture as well as being a professor of Asian studies and history in an English speaking country is really what makes this translation so amazing.  The footnotes at the bottom of each page were an especially nice detail. Oftentimes with weighty classics like this all the footnotes are either at the end of the book with the appendices or at the end of the chapter.  This leads to a lot of fumbling around and flipping pages back and forth and can subsequently take you out of your reading experience.  It is also easier, at least for me, to forget some of the context of what I was reading doing all this flipping back and forth.  Not only do the footnotes themselves add immensely to the depth of understanding of the material but having them at the bottom of the page they are referencing makes reading easy and enjoyable.  Culture specific footnotes really helped me understand the intensity of the situations I was reading about as well as just how funny this book is. As far as the story itself I think everyone should read it.  The story is hilarious and surprisingly modern in its storytelling despite the time it was written.  So many of the most famous animes in pop culture clearly have taken major inspiration from this story.  DBZ alone has ripped off so many elements you'll find yourself laughing at the similarities if you have ever watched DB or DBZ. Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!  Read now please!

The bizarre adventures involving magic and courage are at times very amusing and always astonishing at the invention and imagination of those who wrote this amazing and highly readable, scholarly translated work. The story has been translated into many languages, made into films and simplified versions published for children. Not to be missed.

Yu	AJ Minich	4.0	2010年5月24日 在美国审核	27	Decent translation, but leaves out some of the best tales	I love 'Journey to the West' - the story is China's version of 'The Canterbury Tales', and the tales found within are both seminal works of Chinese literature and rewarding reads in and of themselves.  For this particular edition, Anthony Yu does a good job of translating into English: the prose text is very readable, and Yu's footnotes provide a lot of help on obscure references to Chinese superstitions and Buddhist heritage.  The translations of the poems are somewhat less satisfying, and I found myself frequently skipping over them to read just the prose storyline.  My main complaint is with the books Yu decides to include here: out of the 100 chapters of the full edition, Yu includes only the 31 chapters that are crucial to the plotline.  As a result, you get the barebones story, but some of the best-written and most comical subplots are left out.  All in all, though, a pretty good read, especially for anyone looking for the middle ground between the comic book versions and the full 4-volume 100-chapter text.

After reading the complete set a few years ago, I thought it would be fun to re-read the abridged version when it came out.

What's the rush anyhow? When I finish this, I'll be looking for my next book to read. I believe the first 15 chapters are the same in BOTH versions; so if unsure, you could start with the short one and switch over...

Yu	Richard A., Maxwell	4.0	2007年4月10日 在美国审核	3	Buddhism's Defeat of the Taoist  Quest for Real Immortality	Interesting to note that Xuanzang's journey coincided with the Taoist alchemist's failed attempt to create the elixir of life (immortality). He blundered into gunpowder instead, thus sending mankind down the road to Prometheus, Pandora, and perdition rather than up and over the fabled hill of Sisyphus to the Shangri-la realm of Asklepios and Panacea. The tamed Monkey controlled initially by a fillet and later by himself represents the victory of Buddhism's metaphorical immortality over Taoism's failed experiments in real immortality.  Had Tony Yu made this point in his preface, I'd have given him 5 stars. Note:  Joseph Needham is very good on Taoist alchemy and gunpowder.

For example, when Sun Wukong ("Monkey") calls himself "lao3 sun1" in Chinese, Yu translates that into "old Monkey."  This is just dumb.  Something like a plain "I" or "this old monkey" would have worked better.  There are many such examples.  The translated English text almost requires you to know Chinese to understand.  Definitely not for the masses. 2) I can't believe most of the stories in the 2nd half of the original novel are omitted.  This abridged edition seems to focus on the first half of the Xiyouji ("Journey to the West") novel.  Great stories like the Ox King and the nymphs are completely cut out.  This is just absolutely terrible.  On the other hand, the uninteresting, semi-religious side stories about the origin of Xuanzang (Tang Sanzang) are kept.  What's more, all those poems in the chapters that are included here are retained -- you know, Chinese poems (shi and ci) that are extremely difficult to translate which should have been left out of an abridged edition. In short, don't get this book.  It's absolutely terrible and a waste of money.  You might as well get the unabridged translation, by either Yu (expensive) or by Waley (old but affordable).  But if you really want to appreciate the great novel, you should study Chinese (5-6 years full-time) and then read the original Chinese edition.

I read it first when I was 14 or 15. I thought it was a book on how to smartly fight a war. Then I re-read it when I was 28 and it occurred to me that it may be an instruction book on how to navigate an honorable life. Years passed and I recently found it at the bottom of a box in my closet. I read it again at age 56. I realized it has more to offer. If you read this book, you will actively have to replace Sun Tzus' ancient terms and placement of hierarchy and apply them to modern situations and people. Family, bosses, neighbors, employees and the list goes on. It is my belief that this "manual" can help solve minor and major disruptions in life if used correctly. It is a book meant for good.

Why? Because it's JUST The Art of War. No long intros. No author's notes. No commentary. No 10 pages of history or Sun Tzu biography. It's simply the text of The Art of War translated by an international group of Chinese- and English-speaking scholars. Period. It's the *definitive* text. Complaining about it being short is like complaining about the Gettysburg Address being short. It IS short. That's the POINT. If you want to read dozens of pages of commentary and history and footnotes and acknowledgements, buy a lesser version. If you want to read The Art of War, buy this one.

However, it should be pointed out that this was a public domain reprint and the publishing company did not cite nor include the translator of this piece in any way, it is simply "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. The quality of the print is very good and the material seems to all be there, although, there are many blank pages as shown in the attached image. Again, I did not notice any material actually missing or out of context. I would not purchase this book if you are looking to reference it for scholarly sources or any work in which you would have to reference the content directly. I would definitely encourage the buy if it is for personal use or work that does not require proper citations.

Barber	Jessikj	5.0	2021年2月23日 在美国审核	0	IF YOU ARE A LEADER OR MANAGER OF ANY KIND, READ THIS BOOK!	-If you have inconsistent or poor performances on your team, you NEED to read this book! -If you are the type of leader that is "too nice" and you feel like your employees take advantage of you, you NEED to read this book! -If your employees are terrified of you, you NEED to read this book! This is how this book changed my life: My first big promotion was getting the General Manager position of a restaurant at 21 years old, and I did everything I could to make my employees happy (bringing the principals from "First Break All the Rules- What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently" which is also imperative to help you measure and understand how to make an amazing work environment for your employees), and it worked wonders- at first. My employees were happy and my customer reviews sky rocketed!! However, over time some employees started to push the lines of respect with me and others, and some just started to outright ignore me or give me attitude. I was devastated! How could they treat me disrespectfully after I had spent months bending over backwards finding out and giving them everything they needed to be happy at work??? I praised them tirelessly, I thanked them constantly, I encouraged them, I personally trained them, I got them equipment and supplies they need to do a good job, I was spending one-on-one time with each of them would ask how their lives were, etc! I was the "nicest boss...." who was also turning out to be a pushover. You can have all the kindness in the world but it makes your team useless if you have no discipline at the same time! The Bible says God disciplines His children BECAUSE He loves us. Otherwise, we turn into monsters! Which is what I was beginning to experience with my team. I HAD NO DISCIPLINE, and NEITHER DID MY TEAM. Why would they respect me? I thought discipline was bad- "punishment" you gave and "punishment" was mean. Nope... turns out every team needs it, and if you are CONSISTENTLY and FAIRLY giving predictable and fore-warned discipline all the time, along with kindness, which Sun Tzu talks about in the book as well, you will have an amazing team. This is my favorite quote from the book that finally turned the light bulb on for me:  Page 26 #42-45: "If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual." AND YES IT WAS! Over time, not only did my employees love coming into work EVEN MORE, but they worked harder, my customers were happier, and so was I. People are comforted to know their boss will always be kind AND fair. If you never know how your boss will treat you, it creates uncertainty and anxiety with the team that always leaks out to the customers. It took me only a couple weeks to begin fully implementing this mindset with my employees. At first, I'm not going to lie- it shocked them a bit and they didn't believe when me I would tell them I would be disciplining them if they didn't follow through or finish a direct order I had given them. I had to fire one manager who was undermining me to the team, and then everyone saw I was serious and fell right into line. Of course, I did all of this will extreme kindness. Discipline should never be nasty or hateful or done when you are fuming angry. The employees need kind, proper and consistent warnings before they receive any consequences (which I learned to start doing right from onboarding them at orientation- saved me a lot of time and trouble), and then if and when the time comes for the formal discipline, they know by then that it was totally their choice, and you are only following through on what you said would happen. There are SO MANY MORE GREAT QUOTES in this book. Just get it. Get a highlighter and pick out the diamonds that you need. Go over them time and again and become the amazing leader of your life and of your team you are meant to be!

Barber	Just A Buyer	5.0	2012年10月30日 在美国审核	14	The Art of War (Christian Audio)	This Audio Book has no commentary and is the writings of The Art of War by Sun Tzu only. I have The Art of War in written form with and without Commentary and frankly like the version without commentary better. I really like this Audio version. The reader has a good voice, easy to understand and doesn't interject his personal emotional  feeling during the reading. It is read in narrative form without the reading of Chapter number or or number of the paragraphs. For example Attack by Fire or The Use of Spies, followed by Sun Tzu says, then the subject under that heading.  This is actually a plus for me since it's very easy to follow the logic under each area of instruction, making a very smooth easy to follow narrative. A person can follow along with a written copy if they wish, but I found myself laying the book down, kicking back, and simply listening to the smooth logical, easy to follow reading. This is a small audio book but very enjoyable and still instructional. I have listened to this several times and still learn and just plain enjoy the reading.  At 69 years old that sometimes isn't easy with some Audio Books I have. I do recommend this one. You can download this into Media Player and make a Playlist, the chapter headings are shown, you can't bookmark if you stop but I simply write down the chapter I stopped in and the verse on a slip of paper in my written copy which allows me to come back later and pick up where I left off in the Audio Book. There may be an easier way but I don't know it. Hope this helps someone.

(start at location 505)	"the Art of War" by Sun Tzu is a concise treatise packed with wisdom.  Countless reams of scholarly research has been generated in the millenia since Sun Tzu wrote this masterpiece. Unfortunately, this edition seems to jam all of that research as inline notes into the text itself.  It is virtually impossible to distinguish what Sun Tzu wrote contrasted against what someone else wrote about Sun Tzu.  The research is good; it's just impossible to read through. I tried to read this, but got so fed up that I edited   of "the Art of War" with all of the notes and research linked into an appendix instead of inline with the text.  As a result, you can read "the Art of War" free from the interruptions and distractions of scholars and analysts.  Still, if you want that research, it's available in the appendix.  Every section links to its related notes, and even the related notes link to one another. In full disclosure, I am the editor of the copy that I linked to, but I think you'll find it much easier to read.  (After all, I should.)  If you prefer this free edition, do yourself a favor, and start at location 505.  That is the beginning of Sun Tzu's work, and will let you skip all of the introduction which is little more than the translator's story of this work.

This is The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated to English. This version however does not include the commentary by the translator. There has been many versions of The Art of War translated into English over the years by many different people and all of them will vary in length. The bulk of the book that people are talking about is the sometimes 300+ pages of commentary by the translator and in some editions a 20+ page forword and sometimes a 60+ page introduction. This is the bare bones unabridged edition of The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated into English. You are not missing any content from The Art of War itself. You are just missing (in my opinion) meaning was commentary from the translator and any forwards or introductions some versions may have. As far as Sun Tzu's writings they are fully intact.

It is the book with a black cover and white font on it. It had absolutely no commentary or anything in it. Just the stuff by Sun Tzu. Still....it's so short! I guess for the price it makes sense. As for word choice in this particular book, Wikipedia had better translations of the chapters. For example, chapter 3 in the book is labeled, "Attack by Stratagem." It feels so clumsy compared to "Strategic Attack." With the amount of blank pages in the book(after every chapter), they could have easily filled in the original Chinese for side by side comparison. I probably would have just read this online. A paper copy is good to have around, but because the price is cheap, the book paper quality is cheap as well. There seems to be little effort in formatting too. The book is in an ubiquitous font like Times New Roman. This book simply did not fit my needs for the reasons above, and I will probably be searching for another book. However if you are looking to have a simple copy of The Art of War in paperback form, this is the right book for you.

That being said, I have read other versions of this book over the years and have always found something of interest, so when my college age daughter asked me about it we picked up this one for her Kindle. I was surprised when she said it was hard to follow so downloaded it to my Kindle, and I was shocked that Thomas Cleary went way over the top with his comments and analysis, bogging down the flow and relatively easy understand original language. In fact, it is the clear and simple way Sun Tzu expressed his "rules" that has made his book so popular and relevant for the past 2000 years or so. The solution is straight forward enough since the translation is good, all of the text is there and it is easy enough to skim through Mr. Cleary's contributions. Recommended, with the above caveats.

I actually ordered is via Amazon for Kindle. It was an easy read, nothing really to complex or difficult to understand. Basis of this book is that it was written in China over two thousand years ago, Sun Tzu's The Art of War provides the first known attempt to formulate a rational basis for the planning and conduct of military operations. His essays contain principles acted upon by such twentieth-century Chinese generals as Mao Zedong. The book is translated by the late Samuel B. Griffith. Samuel Griffith offers an insightful translation of this classic, which makes it even more relevant to the modern world. If you are taking a class and need the book or just want to brush up on your twentieth century military tactics, I suggest this book. I hope this review helps.

However, according to Wikipedia, many military organizations and many successful generals have read and benefitted from this work.  Based on their reputations, I'll accord this classic the respect that it claims. Throughout the book, the author describes the morale and motivation of people and how it will affect what they actually do.  An army is not a collection of chess pieces or cardboard counters that behave according to some printed rules.  It's a group of humans that will fight, retreat, give up, or go crazy, depending on what they experience. I have to take off one star.  The free Kindle edition has an overly long introduction plus a large amount of in-body notes.  The in-body notes look way to similar to the text.  I want to read more of Sun Tzu's words, and more important, I want it obvious which words are Sun Tzu's and which are not.

Its one of those books that is so broadly read and studied that its pretty necessary background for studying wars generally.  If you are reading other books on war for example, you can be pretty sure that most of the players have been influenced by this book.  Further, there's just a lot of interesting advice in here, "There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare" and thus there are instructions on how important it is to bring a conflict to a head and a swift conclusion.  Its a classic for a reason, and even if you don't find it compelling given the sheer number of people that have been influenced by it, it becomes a must read based on that alone.  I can certainly imagine I'll be quoting from this on multiple occasions.

Barber	Matthew Phelps	1.0	2009年9月9日 在美国审核	5	Absolute crap	The Art of War is required reading for U.S. Marine officers, so I wanted to get my own copy for my bookshelf. Of course, the best option would be to learn Chinese and study the original text. Short of that, a good translation is required. If Mr. Giles is a good translator, he's a horrible editor. This edition uses no style markings to denote what is from the original or what is editorial. As you can see by viewing the first few pages on this item's page, you can see that everything runs together. The reader can't possibly get a feel for the style or composition of the original because the entire text is peppered with commentary, not all of which is bracketed off by the the editor, and none of which is even set into its own area or paragraph. There are no footnotes, endnotes, or index. Keep looking if you're interested in reading Sun Tzu's masterpiece. I'll update this review when I've found an edition suitable for reading and recommending--this one is going back to Amazon today.

The book I received was the full length text, but chapter 10 and 6 were switched in the book for some reason though. Some of the translations were different from other publications of the book. I believe that this book does not read as well as some other publications because of the differences in phrasing, but this does not hurt the content of the text. Seems as if this publisher is a bit of a dice roll with what some of the other reviews are saying, but there does seem to be a positive trend.

With this deficiency layered on the author's frequent bracketed interjections, footnotes and cross-page references, addition of numerous names and locations, the core message is all but unintelligible for me as a first time reader of the Art of War and novice in Chinese history and historical geography.  The author seeks to improve upon previous translations by pulling the best from each, adding his own, and contextualizing.  This noble purpose may have backfired because I am leaving this version of the book feeling I should have read Tu Mu's version, which the author quoted frequently and which seems lucid and easy to understand.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	the.galloglach	4.0	2014年1月6日 在美国审核	1	Excellent book	Art of War is an ancient Chinese text on the practice of warfare, both physical and psychological. While much of the treatise is metaphorical in expression, with a little critical thinking the axioms of warfare are true in many aspects of life. This edition includes many annotations which relate the expressions to other Chinese texts on martial activities and commentaries on the manuscript itself, which can be helpful in understanding the metaphors. When reading, one should bear in mind that while the text particularly relates to warfare, the values which are promulgated therein can be readily applied to principles of business, multiple levels of security, and personal life.

I guess I got spoiled because I had a different version of the book with Samuel B. Griffith, but gave it away a few years back in a "purge" of my shelves.  I shouldn't have let that one go:  it's a gem.  All you get with this one is the bare-bones translation of the script. It is, however, much less expensive.  I am glad I read the other book I mentioned with the background material and analysis.  The original script is an ancient writing, in Chinese, and a little difficult to understand without some background or comment.  I suggest that if you want to understand the meanings of Sun Tzu more fully, buy the other book.

While the book IS about war--about forming and implementing strategies, and drawn from real life experience, Sun Tzu's lessons can be applied effectively in any life situation involving 2 or more people--the more adversarial, the better LOL. Sun Tzu has stood by me through thick and thin--his sage advice has made a big difference in my personal approach to business deals, handling employees, dealing with various professionals from a subservient position--even dealing with pushy doctors and controlling ex spouses. Sun Tzu is about LIFE. Because like it or not, life isn't fair, it isn't always fun, and some times--you need to be able to be assertive without being aggressive, and you have to be willing to be adversarial to get what you need. This is a worthwhile read for ANYONE--both from an advice and tactics point of view, AND for the clarity of style, turn of phrase, and excellent use of metaphor. I have yet to run into a BAD translation of Tzu, and this one was no exception.

Sun Tzu wrote this book about matters he considered serious so even being a short book by today's standards it applies to important matters (it is read and studied a most major military higher training facilities the world over.)  The applications are not just military but can be applied to any situation where there is a conflict between two entities.

I can't see how it would be an essential element of turning anyone into a successful general.  You can learn most of the basic lessons presented by Sun Tzu by playing "war" or "cowboys & indians" in the mountains of Pennsylvania.  If you had a deprived childhood (your Mom & Dad kept guns away from you and did not allow you to play "violent" childhood games), I recommend you read the book and pay attention to basic tactics and the value of planning and using all available resources.  Because it is short and instructional it should be a quick read and worth your time (even if you read it only to satisfy your curiosity).  I was a bit disappointed, given the hype of the book.  The general repeats himself and often makes a big deal of the obvious. If you want to become the next General Macarthur or General Patton, make better use of your time and look elsewhere.  If you think there is a need for another Napolean type, then maybe this would be a good start.  If you are still curious, have the time, & a couple of bucks, buy it and read it.

I was glad to finally read this book, however I was burdened with so much history and "back-story" as to who Sunzi was, if in fact he existed.  There seemed to be about 33% of the book in setting up of who Sunzi was before we read his first line of teachings. It is great to read his teachings, but all the setup seems unnecessary and somewhat irritating.  I already had a pretty good idea about Sunzi and strictly wanted to read his teachings.  I think, in short, his teachings could be written in a handful of pages and one could interpret from there, but that is not the case with this version. I would still recommend this friends and family, but it would come with a strong warning about the setup and the seemingly constant commentary, which distracted me from really enjoying his teachings.

It does more than justice to the original novel, and even provides side notes of interesting commentary by other historically significant characters (generals, warlords and others who have noted on the word of Sun Tzu) and even accounts of real battle applications. Definitely worth the price. I enjoyed every minute of this work, and even as a less-than-avid reader, it was a very enjoyable experience.

What some say about being able to use his ideas in other areas, like business, is a legitimate claim, as the ideas are about beating an enemy, not specifically about how to win a war on th  battlefield. Must-read for any student of history, military or otherwise, and those in the business world wanting to learn a couple tricks to get a leg-up.

Barber	Jenifer Horst	5.0	2016年2月18日 在美国审核	1	The chapters in this book describe one of the world's greatest general's philosophy on war and strategy	The book Art of War written by Sun Tzu is military treasure trove of military tactics.  This is a stunning display of 13 chapters that were written over 2500 years.  The chapters in this book describe one of the world's greatest general's philosophy on war and strategy. The book discusses different ways to command troops and the pitfalls associated with war.  Sun Tsu states that the faster your troops move, the more troops are lost in the process.  The author's philosophy here is to show that more careful planning to military strategy will save lives and hopefully achieve success on the battlefield. The Art of War can be applied to life in general and not just military tactics.  Taking one's time in planning will lead to less strife, fewer problems, and reaching one's goals.  This book is a great read for anyone interested in military strategy and philosophy.  I highly recommend it!

It is the words of the great general Sun Tzu from the Warring States Period in ancient China (around 400b.c.). This is particular edition is very clear and precise, however short. It is the bare basics and a great intro to other higher level editions, as well as books on warfare. I would recommend reading every line over until you grasp what Sun Tzu was trying to say. I would also think it beneficial if you followed up reading a more through edition, perhaps the 2005 hard cover edition of The Illustrated Art of War by Samuel Griffith, followed by The Art of Warfare by Sun Tzu's descendant Sun Pin (Sun Bin). In short, this is a great, easy to learn, piece of Chinese literature that is a great intro to the philosophy of warfare which can be applied to everyday life and leadership.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	John P. Jones III	4.0	2015年3月25日 在美国审核	2	On searching for that inverted tortoise shell...	"The Art of War" is a compendium of the military experience and wisdom of Sun Tzu, which is an honorific given to the author, Sun Wu. It was written over two millennium ago. Naturally there are varying theories and disputes as to who actually wrote it, and which version is correct. There is also the matter of the proper translation. The one I read was translated by Lionel Giles in 1910. It is one of the most, if not the most influential text on military strategy and tactics. Mao Zedong, Vo Nguyen Giap and Douglas MacArthur are only three of the many military leaders who credit the importance of Sun Tzu work in guiding their thinking. It remains an essential "textbook" at the military colleges in the United States, and is also required reading in the CIA. I finally decided to read this classic in search of a specific quote that I had been told was from Sun Tzu's work, and which I had had some personal experience with: "Never fight on a battlefield that resembles an inverted tortoise shell."  I didn't find the quote, but perhaps I found the opposite. At least the tortoise shell reference SOUNDS like something he might have said. The author did grab my attention with an anecdote in the introduction which underscored one of his aphorisms: "If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders are clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers." In the anecdote, it is women who are divided into two sides, each led by one of the emperor's favorite concubines. Because they could not maintain proper discipline among their "troops," each of the concubines is beheaded, despite the protests of the emperor. It should be no surprise that their replacements achieved perfect discipline within the ranks, and Sun Tzu, who proclaimed the army ready, had the temerity to rebuke the emperor with: "The King is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds." (How often such a speaker, in the real world, can keep his own head is not discussed in the text.) There is much wisdom in this text. For example: "All warfare is based on deception." "There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare." On a good leader: "Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilize combined energy." And one that Vo Nguyen Giap must have taken to heart: "Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances." (that is, he did not repeat the tactics that led to victory at Dien Binh Phu by repeating them at Khe Sanh; instead he went for Saigon, and the American public via television) As for that "inverted tortoise shell," the one passage that seemed closest to addressing this issue seemed to imply the opposite: "Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys." And, "Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare." (Certainly Giap seemed to have disregarded that one). And there seems to be that "classic problem" of all too many "holy" books. There are passages that imply "this", and passages that imply the opposite of "this."  For example, on the all-important matter of logistics and supply, Sun Tzu says:  "Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy," and "Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own."  But on the other hand: "We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost, without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost." There is much good advice that seems to be routinely ignored, despite its place in the curriculum, such as the emphasis on short, decisive wars and the repeated admonitions to know the enemy. Conversely, there are the passages that can be chosen to buttress one argument, and others to buttress the counter-argument. Overall, 4-stars.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Vince	5.0	2015年8月12日 在美国审核	6	Rules of war don't win, it is the art of war that does.	This guy was light years ahead of his time. His battles depended on mostly tactics based on what the weather conditions were, and what form of territory and environment you're in, and to ration your army's energy during a battle, and when to fight and when not to.  (It's a damn good thing that Hitler didn't do his homework on this.) And basically show that the rules of war is, was, and always will be, BS. His tactics are still put to good use even to this very day, thou it's original intention was for future wars, but it's put into practice for other means. For instance, football coaches, company managers, even the great Bobby Fisher took a  few tips from this guy's book. So in retrospect, technology and engineering may have completely obliterated the dynamics of the rules of war, but the art is still the same.

When I first sought out this book I did so because it seems to be everywhere. Everyone seems to have either read it or knows someone very close who has. It is in several movies and television shows; the list goes on. So I told myself, "I need to read this just to see what it is," and when it arrived I was surprised. The book is incredibly smaller than I would have ever predicted, but this is not to say it is void of content. It seems to me to have been written in such a way as to avoid any irrelevant information. Without quoting or divulging its 'secrets,' The Art of War is a unique tool for looking into the strategic mind of the past, and for improving/refining/solidifying your own theory.

Sun Tzu's Art of War is one of those world's finest classic literatures that marks and influences those who will challenge themselves to read this military treatise. It discusses tactics and strategies in military affairs, that are implicitly related and indirectly applied to the fields of business affairs, human psychology, management, ancient history, military sciences, politics, anatomy of organizations in conflicts, and the likes. Classics remain classics not because they were written in the ancient times; they were called classics because they continue to have meanings - different meanings when read in different circumstances and moods. They become more useful as we use them, therefore we grow wiser with them. Understanding Sun Tzu's treatise is understanding ancient methods of resolving conflicts, handling battles, and hailing to the great spiritual tradition of Taoism.

For those on business, get this right: if the vision and mission of the organization are clear, but the members or employees are not acting accordingly, the leadership is to blame, and MUST be FIRED, or maybe worse...

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Joseph E Botts	2.0	2015年6月7日 在美国审核	1	I expected much more.	Having heard so much about Sun Tzu and his wisdom, I was prepared for something much better.  His writing might impress someone with no experience in the field, but for those who have a general knowledge of the outdoors and warfare, it is not very enlightening. What makes it particularly disappointing to me is the fact that he contradicts himself so many times.  It would seem that the whole idea is to impress people with his wisdom rather than actually impart anything of any real value. There is some good advice, but nothing that is much above the common sense of an American Eagle Scout and most of the successes are simply the result of deception and ruthlessness. Something that is repeated several times is the fact that trying to fight a war in faraway places can be very expensive and difficult.  Considering the fiascoes of Korea and Vietnam, we should already know this by bitter experience!  So other than a few examples of deception and trickery, I really did not see a lot of military expertise in his accomplishments. One of the things that I disliked the most about the book, was that it is printed in a font so small that it is very hard on the eyes.  All in all, I don't feel the book was worth the small price I paid for it.

Barber	Vagabond of Letters	2.0	2018年4月20日 在美国审核	1	4/10 Review of the unabridged and unannotated Cleary translation; ...	4/10 Review of the unabridged and unannotated Cleary translation; 97pp. Likely revolutionary when it was first written, the wisdom contained in this book is now 'old hat' common sense. The parts directly applicable to war, with few exceptions (such as 'know thy enemy and know thyself and fear no defeat') are exclusively applicable to 1st generation warfare, fought with sword, horse, bow, and static fortifications, though a few pages give a prècis of what should be expected of an officer corps and disciplined army which are applicable to any multi-tier centralized organization. The rest of the book is taken up with descriptions of terrain types, etc. with no modern practical nor metaphorical application that I could discern. (I wonder how many generals got their men slaughtered because they read this book and thought they understood war. Likely more than the mandarin system advanced to high government post on stylized understanding of the five classics and their commentaries.) Of the much-praised 'business strategy' or 'general strategy' or 'the art of war as life', I read little.

Barber	Merlyn	5.0	2014年1月12日 在美国审核	0	A bit overrated as a source for Wall Street tycoons	During the 1980s, in the wake of Reagan economics and greed on Wall Street, every tycoon wannabe read this book as a text for making money.  That isn't why Sun Zi wrote it.  He wrote it as a primary text for wannabe generals and military tacticians.  I suspect Erwin Rommel read it, the Desert Fox who kept the British Army at bay during his Afrika Campaign.  Written in the typical style of Chinese, short and succinct, it is a very great look at military tactics.

This book is not only for warfare on the battlefield but in your life. In some ways a fighting man's Tao Te Ching. Sunzu's classic prepares you for dealing with the cruel and duplicitous. I have read the book in Chinese and English and can confirm this is an excellent translation. It's funny how business people use the book when really they are just exercising their greed. The book is not about stealing but about gaining an advantage but always for the purpose of good and benefit of all. Over and over Sunzi discusses how the leader must consider their subordinates to achieve success. The story will remain useful throughout time.

This understanding of personal autonomy is, in my opinion, the most important lesson given.

THIS is the book you need. It was mandatory reading when I was in the Marines. The lessons and actions of troops has changed very little over the course of time. If you wonder why commanders do what they do please read this book.

Written in simple, descriptive language that anyone can read and apply to whatever adversarial situation presents itself. It can even be interpreted as a relationship guide! The Art of War also states ways of "fighting without having to fight at all." Brilliant and as relatable as it was when it was originally written.

This is a little book I love, while some it is changed by the logistics of our modern flight-based world of today, the gist of it right to the point is that every time we ignored the most basic advice in this book, we lost or backed out of a war that we failed to understand why the other side fought so hard for, such as the Vietnam war, where North Vietnam's General Giap and the Vietcong used a very successful 'Go' strategy while we lost the war by not understanding the strategy of the enemy, attempted to use a chess strategy, to our detriment.('Go' is a game where you occupy the most territory with the least number of pieces, in chess you occupy the most territory with the most pieces with the sole objective being to capture the King.) You will find much to contemplate in reading this book if you like to think, and you value freedom, democracy, liberty and the responsibility of keeping and maintaining that democracy as the flip-side of liberty. Freedom/Responsibility go hand in hand to those who want to keep this experiment in democracy we love so dearly.

No good all I get is "my cd" and the chapters reading the same. I used Media Monkey to rip and look up Amazon DB for tagging, still nothing. It is very annoying when stopping and starting during the day to know what chapter you're on. So this was a waste of money and time trying to tag it and listen to it. Especially when many other audio books are in the same format and trying to go back I may end up listening to another book all together. Not worth the effort to try and manually tag each track. Lesson learned for me and will sell it at work.

S.	2.0	2013年5月29日 在美国审核	1	"The Art of War" a disappointment	I have heard this book touted as "great" so many times that I finally decided to give it a try.  I was most disappointed.  The book is just a series of one-liners on different things to do in war.  Some of the little one-liners didn't even make much sense.  And the book is totally disorganized with no connection from one one-liner to the next.  And finally, there were way too many editing errors.  I was expecting a well-thought-out and organized expose on how to carry out a successful war....something on the order of Machiavelli's very astute and very clear way to obtain and retain power as set out in "The Prince."  No comparison.

Specializing in a singular idea, war, the facts on how to control and be victorious in a battle of metal or mind.

An Acquired Taste	Ancient Wisdom when dealing with battle and military might. I guess I was expecting the wisdom to translate over into everyday life in the modern  corporate or civilian world. It didn't.  However after studying this book I have learned that strategy and taking your enemy into account in all it's variables weakness and strengths is to have higher ground when accessing your attack plans. Basically know your enemy inside and out then let them fall prey to your plans.  I am glad this was a short book because it took a lot of strain to decipher this stuff. It wasn't a fun read at all but I am glad that now I can say that I read it.  Definitely a read for those with an acquired taste. Otherwise a more compatible self empowerment book may be more useful.

I was frequently losing men to fatigue, and simply not controlling my army effectively. After purchasing, my victory rate has increased significantly, and I am a much more trained war general. Very good day-to-day read for prospective buyers who control armies.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	JMG Buyer	3.0	2013年7月25日 在美国审核	0	It Was Average	I bought this as I read another review which mentions this book as a better alternative. Was not as thrilled as I thought I would be. I have other books on the Art of War that are far more explanation and practical use driven than this one.  The principles are easy but sometimes it was the commentaries from other military science leaders that convoluted the meanings and put their "spin" on Tzu's philosophy. While this is good for some, I bought this book for myself and another to just get the nuts and bolts.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	R. Lay	3.0	2017年4月15日 在美国审核	0	Interesting	Highly regarded by my friends who served in the military, I found the book most interesting in that the supposedly real-life author, Sun-Tzu, penned a series of letters that b came one of the earliest handbooks of war fighting. The translation I read had way too much commentary inserted throughout the text, making it difficult to get into the rhythm of the book. And obviously, the translations that survived are incomplete. Chapters appear to be missing entire sections, there is much that is desultory and even contradictory (especially the many chapters and sections on terrain) and even more that is simply obvious, even in the era these writings were thought to be composed.

This version does include most if not all of the maxims in Sun Tzu's Art of War. Unfortunately, with no introduction, no context, no commentary, and no annotations (present in many other versions), it's hard to make any sense of this vague and metaphorical ancient text. I would advise against buying this version if you want a thorough understanding of this seminal work.

"The art of war" teaches us not to fight a war if it's not a sure-win.  The philosophy behinds this is to reserve the scarce resources and human lives, never fight a war on impulse.  Plan, calculate, and win.  If not a sure-win, diplomacy and negotiation are preferred.  The original "The Art of War" in Chinese was written in 5th century BC, had only thirteen chapters and about six thousand Chinese characters, not a huge book, but the content was time-tested, proven to be effective even nowadays.  Read it, you won't regret.

It points out much as to how you should handle situations and like the bible for the needy, it is rather written as hyperbole and generalities of situations not a detailed explanation of each battle situation.  I really emphasizes deceit and distraction rather than actually just racing to battle.  Preparation and patience are also much of the emphasis.  It OK, but of course it is a basic primer.

The "First Thus edition" from Filiquarian publishing is a terrible translation. I suspect they used Google Translate with a bit of help from a human. (They don't even list the translator.) As another reviewer pointed out, it reads like those terrible instructions you get in cheap Chinese products. This book (as with many historical books) is difficult to shop for on Amazon. I'm headed to my local B&N to flip through different translations.

I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the editing and formatting of this kindle edition.  This version contains no chapter stops and has numerous flaws including but not limited to inconsistent indentations, Incomplete paragraph breaks and the use of "-" instead of proper horizontal line breaks. The text itself is little changed from the translation made a hundred year ago (as I believe it should be).  My negative rating on this book is restricted to the poor presentation on kindle and if it is fixed and uploaded to my kindle I would be happy to change my rating.

Often quoted in military circles, yet not implemented as often as it should be. Book is alright, just dated a little and probable should only be used as a primer or beginning step. The world may have changed a bit since this was written, but the human element has not. Take this as a beginning step only. The book should be owned by every member of the military, law enforcement, salesmen, and those that enter into negotiations.

U Yes there are specific points of how to attack and from where, but by the time it is completed it felt more like is was giving life lessons as well. I thought it odd and inspiring in a way that the author could merge these thoughts rather the solely concentrate on how to kill your enemy. I'll be reading it again.

The author really does not know when to shut up.  The Art of War and other works from Asia (allow me to recommend Go Rin No Sho by Miyamoto Musashi) really benefit from some perspective and discussion from the translator.  I get that. This guy has to interject his thoughts right in the middle of the source work. Often his thoughts are many times longer than the text that is the focus of his ramblings. But don't be dissuaded from taking on this master piece because of this, after a few moments you will learn how to skip the blather (the first quarter of the book and then sometimes 2 &  3 pages at a time) and read the book as translated.  On the second read through maybe the third,  go ahead and enjoy what our author has to share. His perspective is not bad,  but the book is an editorial nightmare.

Sun Tzu spouts off a bunch of useless crap like: "If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive." Thank you Sun Tzu, for summarizing war into neat little equations for us: Function for computing losses during outmaneuver operation: F(x) = (if x = 50 then 1 leader and 0.50 of force else if x = 0.333 then 0.6667 of force)

This was a written around the 5th or 6th century B.C. by Sun Tzu, one of the most powerful Chinese generals of that era. Spoken basically like proverbs, he gives a general overview of conducting war. I didn't care for the commentaries, that went with it, but I absolutely LOVED the thoughts of Sun Tzu. Not only does it open your eyes to the fact that warfare is more than what occurs on the battlefield, but also the tactic that the enemy uses against us.

Barber	Abaraham Endale	4.0	2016年5月1日 在美国审核	0	The most straightforward book I've ever read	While reading the art of war, I immediately realized the influence this book has said not only in military strategy but also in business. The strategies mentioned in the book has been repeated throughout history and I enjoyed that the Chinese General was very straightforward in good descriptions. No sugar coding, no complex metaphors, is all black and white and its up to the reader to form hisher opinion on it. I'm positive many corporate tycoons used the strategies for corporate takeovers and countries have used the book as a way to win wars and sack cities. This can be pretty dangerous season in the wrong hands so I recommend anyone in a leadership position to delve into this short but concise book for a few hours.

If you're like me then you can look past that and just enjoy the book, which is entirely legible. Also, the book has no printing on the end...which makes it hard to see on a book shelf. Not that big of a deal to me because I know where it is and lets honest...that's all that matters! If however you are one of those pretentious douche-bags that likes showing off just cultured you are, you might want to go with a copy that someone might enter your room, see it and think to them self, "gee, I hope their greatness rubs off on me."

I bet if the Kardashians all the fashion bloggers in the world would post a pic with this book saying they loved it.

This is considered a loose translation of the original and has been condensed down into basic understandings about how to win wars.  It would be a quick read.  It's a brutal topic, imo.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Mary Soon Lee	5.0	2017年1月13日 在美国审核	33	Succinct advice for military commanders. Highly recommended (but not this edition).	Written over two thousand years ago, in a time when wars were fought with chariots, this book offers succinct advice for military commanders. It reminds me of Machiavelli's "The Prince," which offers succinct advice for rulers. Both books are brief. Both books offer astute and sometimes provocative guidance. Both books derive additional interest from their historical importance. But I found "The Art of War" by far the easier read (part of a single afternoon), whereas, for me, "The Prince" was hard going. Two quotes to give a flavor of the book: "All warfare is based on deception." "Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting." I highly recommend this book, but not this specific edition, which appears to use the Lionel Giles translation without bothering to credit Mr. Giles (deceased he may be, but he deserves acknowledgment). Moreover, the edition lacks an introduction to provide historical context, and the ninth chapter has been moved forward without explanation.

It is not as useful for the fields for which it was intended, however; those being the military and intelligence fields. Readers from those professions are better served by the translations by Griffith or Sawyer, who share more relevant insights than the less experienced Giles.

I read the first half of that crap so I can see why so many people are mad at it. Just skip it and read Sun's words, it isn't too hard to do when you have a kindle.

Delivery was very fast and the price was the best I was able to find. I hear repeatedly about how this book should be read if you are interested in the subjects of national security or simply to get an understanding of current world events.  These recommended reading lists should be updated as there are many far better books on the theory or aggression, mechanics and psychology of troop movements and battle, and theory of war.  The complexity of our current socioeconomic arena and how the world responds often defies explanation utilizing historic strategies and theories.

There are very visible cracks at the back cover and not only one or two cracks: there are a LOT of them.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Agrippa's Epiphany	5.0	2015年1月5日 在美国审核	12	Excellent Reading for Those Who Seek Peace	Reading this text through the lens of Christian doctrine has shown that many archetypal beliefs exist among men of faith. Within this text, the man of war is presented as a well-disciplined and wise individual who abhors war. For him, war is the last option and not the first. This ancient book of wisdom contrast with the practices of many modern world leaders. The translator's introduction often references the  Tao te Ching which might also be excellent reading for the man of faith who hopes that the can communicate his beliefs with others who have a background in Eastern philosophy (1 Corinthians 9:19-23). If sustained peace ever enters this modern era, it will come from the body of faithful, peaceful, and well-disciplined men. Much like Gideon and other Biblical accounts, the text states that the greatest warrior can win a war without fighting a battle. Unfortunately, this text often is read by greedy, power-hungry individuals who do not seek peace and are misled by the title. The teachings which I contains can be used for "good" or "evil". With this text, one can heal "difficult" situations or promote anarchy as the modern physician can heal or kill with prescription medicine. This is a powerful text and excellent reading.

However, it seems that the formatting of the book is very poorly done. Bullet points and lists are simply listed out in a single paragraph, and there is no apparent effort to make the ideas visually clear. I would steer clear of this printing and invest in a better-presented edition of the book.

What I rate with one star is the fact that with this issue there is no foreword. It just says "Filiquarian Publishing LLC" from what you cannot find out who translated the book? Is it Sam Griffith's translation? Or whose? It doesn't even say basic stuff about Sun Tzu. Nothing. If you ask me, find a free pdf on the net and print it yourself (just 60 pages) because sadly, there is no value for money in this print.

I have wanted to read this for a long time now only b/c I've heard so much about how you can apply it's theories to every day life.  Well, I suppose you can. Sorta.  But after a while it gets exhausting hearing about how you need to wake up earlier than your enemy; know more than you're enemy; be more rested than your enemy; blah blah blah.  Long story short, study hard.  Work hard.  I'm glad I have quenched my curiosity, but I'm glad I got it on the kindle and that it's NOT taking up room on my bookshelf.  It ain't that special.

Took me an 1-1/2 to read and I don't really read so easy to read over and over so I can remember it. Something everyone needs to read regardless of life job or religion.

Which took about 1/4th of the book.  I wondered if the book proper itself would ever start.  Now that I finished the book I don't remember any the Preface.  Then the book part finally started which consisted of hundreds of little pieces of advice by Master Sun.  Sentence to paragraph length.  Each piece of advice was followed by a short explanation or repetition by another Master of what Master Sun had just stated.  When did this format end?  When the book ended.  As Sun was allegedly the Master, I eventually started just reading Sun's comments which allowed me to get to the end much quicker.  At least now I can truthfully say that I did, in fact, finish reading the book.  I marked one sentence in the book to be added to my review but now I can't find it.

I must first admit, I had bought into the hype over how The Art of War is the greatest strategic document ever produced.  I was expecting some fantastic insight and in reality, the Art is, like most brilliant strategies, very simple and basic steps to follow.  The trick is to not overlook the basics and keeping the discipline to always follow them. The book itself was set up into a very long and rambling prologue, then quotes from Sun Tzu followed by quotes from other Chinese leaders and/or philosophers.  There is no discussion about the meaning or intent of Sun Tzu beyond the quotes from the supporting cast.  In short, the book is written with quotes supported by other quotes without any context.  If you read books to get the full story and context behind a subject, go elsewhere.  If you are content with sound bytes and 10 second clips, this book is for you.

The version with the black cover, white text, and two horizontal red bars above and below Sun Tzu's name is the one to which I am referring. I have only read a few pages, but they are riddled with typos. Pg. 6 (actually page 3) "While heading the profit of my council..." The word is "heeding." Almost certainly an English as a second language translator who didn't run this by a decent editor.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	madhead	2.0	2019年1月27日 在美国审核	1	Overrated	Bullshit bingo book. You'll find famous quotes all around it, in every chapter. It is best to win without fighting. Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization. A leader leads by example not by force. Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley. Speed is the essence of war. And many many others. Sound familiar? Right. They are used by everybody taken out of the context. Especially by life / career / business coaches of all kinds. Mid-level managers, C-level executive wannabes. By that kind of people, not by military professionals. I can hardly believe that somebody who has professional military education will learn anything from this book. It's nothing more but a common sense. Like: "do not fight when you can". C'mon! We all know that already! "Hide your weaknesses and strength from the enemy". Of course I'll do! "Attack at the weakest point". Sure, nobody wants to die in a suicide mission fighting outnumbering entrenched enemy. And so on. I can hardly believe that modern military commanders use Sun Tzu's terrain, battlegrounds and positions categorization. As well as any other typification from this book. You can now bomb an enemy or send a drone. Or a nuke. Or a SEAL squad. Infantry and cavalry lost some of it's importance during the last 2500 years passed. The war (despite "war never changes") has changed a lot since then. Think about this: the book was actually written by Sun Tzu for his master, king of the state of Wu, when Sun Tzu served Wu during the confrontation with the state of Chu. So, the context of this book is: China, Zhou dynasty era, state of Wu. And the role of this book is clear too: to summarize the knowledge available at that time. So, the book cannot be used by it's direct purpose nowadays — to teach military personnel, and it became popular in another roles: to be a source of quotes for people who want to show others that they read smart books; and to be used for "inspiration", mostly by white-collars. By people who will never use 99% of this book on practice. Because, you know, you cannot "camp in high places, facing the sun", "gather in plunder" and "put men to death together with whom the secret was told" and do other fun stuff from this book when you're just a clerk. Even a CEO cannot literally put a man to death today. And, yes, Sun Tzu is not always humane in this book. One can say that "The Art of War" is a philosophical book, not a tactics / strategy guide. Probably. That's why I'm giving it two stars. There was some kind of mysterious zen in it, but I didn't become enlightened a lot. The book, again, is nothing special but a common sense of 2500-year-old war practice.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	J. D. Estrada	5.0	2017年12月26日 在美国审核	0	Ample lessons for life in all its facets	I began by reading an annotated version of the Art of War and switched midway to the original text because although the notes you can find in the free version on Amazon, it was a bit disruptive and I wanted to read the original text before digging deeper. That said, this is a fascinating book to read simply because it makes so much sense for so many things. For people in business, the metaphors are easily adaptable to a business model and no doubt this book has been read by many a high ranking official if only to gain understanding of what it takes to win. The same could go for coaches and even lawyers. Basically any scenario where there are two sides and both are seeking to be the victor can benefit from this. But there are some interesting ways where you can adapt what is said in this book. To mediate conflicts you can use many of the same steps and recommendations postulated within. The main thing that is sought from the Art of War is to win with as little bloodshed as possible. For many, the word war is synonymous with bloodshed, conflict, and loss of life. For Sun Tzu, avoiding all that is what makes the best general. If you can position things to the point where engaging in battle is folly and thus surrender is a better option, then you can see where he's coming from. In addition, there's another application I can recommend... having this text be read by writers. Conflict is embedded in what we write and for us who write fantasy and science fiction, battles on paper are common place. If you want to make a battle believable, study the things talked about in this book in detail and humanize the decisions taken, the actions carried out, and the mistakes that are part of a believable scenario. A rich read that will no doubt yield knowledge in its original and annotated versions.

Add graphic artwork = entertaining introduction to the classic.  I recommend it.  Buy the hard copy, not Kindle. It is not the original full edition of the classic. This Smartercomic is not intended to be the full text. I read the Art of War or Strategy in college and several times thereafter. I refer to it periodically. The critics miss the point of this edition:  an introduction and entertainment. After reading this edition, you will want to read the original. It is enjoyable to read, easy to understand, and the artwork gives the reader a different perspective and promotes the application in today’s world.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	John M. Balouziyeh	5.0	2010年8月6日 在美国审核	25	In some ways outdated, in others, prophetic	A. Overview The ancient Chinese military general Sun Tzu lays out a blueprint for the effective waging of war. In his classic The Art of War, the successful war campaign largely revolves around two key elements: deception and surprise. Sun Tzu also describes the virtues that are required of effective military leaders, and, drawing from his many years of military experience, he gives wide ranging and insightful advice on knowing oneself, knowing one's enemy, and how to keep the spirits of one's soldiers fixed on victory. Throughout his treatise, his words are piercing, direct, at times witty, and often paradoxical. He writes, for example, "If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant" (I.22). "Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength" (V.17). 1. Virtues Necessary for a Successful War Campaign The Commander is to be an exemplar of five virtues: wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness (I.9). Discipline among the Commanders and soldiers is the key to victory. One can even determine which side in a war will be victorious by asking "(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?" (I.13). 2. The Law of Deception The Law of Deception is summarized by Sun Tzu with these words: "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near" (I.18-19). Sun Tzu goes to great lengths in justifying this assertion and in giving examples of how to deceive and to detect deception from the enemy. He writes, "Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat" (IX.24), but "Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot" (IX.26). "At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you" (XI.68). 3. Law of Surprise Attack Surprise is also an important element in weakening the enemy. The military is to "[a]ppear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected" (VI.5), and, "[i]n raiding and plundering, be like fire, in immovability like a mountain" (VII.18). "Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt" (VII.19). 4. Effective Warfare The rest of the treatise focuses on how to wage war in an effective manner. War is to be waged by first knowing oneself and knowing one's enemy. Battle is never undertaken unless one is certain that he will win. Sun Tzu outlines the five principles of victory: "(1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign" (III.17). A successful war campaign is waged efficiently, with the Armed Forces knowing when and how to attack by expending as little effort as possible, for "supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting" (III.2). Few resources are to be expended in an effective war campaign: "The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice" (II.8). Sun Tzu also seems to hint at a metaphysical plane in which warfare is fought. He writes, for example, that the effective Commander "wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated" (IV.13), as though war is first fought on some metaphysical plane before the victory and defeated is reflected in the visible, physical world. B. Critique Some of Sun Tzu's counsel is outdated in the age of terrorism, military insurgencies, and digital and nuclear warfare. Some of it revolves around the size and numbers of the enemy's forces and one's advantage relative to the enemy based on numbers. Similarly, much of his advice is based on obsolete forms of land warfare that are rarely fought in the modern day. He writes, for example, "Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted" (VI.1). This advice will rarely, if ever, be relevant in an age where most warfare is fought in the air or from long range missiles, with forces rarely clashing in land battles. The advent of nuclear weapons also changes the entire equation of relative forces and makes the numbers of infantrymen almost irrelevant. Similarly, the introduction of insurgencies that blend into local populations have been able to render even large armies of well equipped soldiers ineffective and unsuccessful. Furthermore, the advent of digital and cyber-warfare makes the numbers of enlisted and commissioned soldiers largely irrelevant to foreign attacks. Though the forms of warfare have changed over the ages, many of Sun Tzu's principles continue to apply. Whether fighting a land battle or an air battle, the laws of deception and surprise attack are still relevant and highly effective. Furthermore, Sun Tzu outlines lessons that are important not only for the battlefield, but also for the general struggles of life. He writes, "You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked" (VI.7). This is advice that should be heeded by businessmen, political leaders, and anyone else in a position that requires defending against an onslaught of attacks or competition.

Barber	Shaun Heneghan	5.0	2015年9月14日 在美国审核	0	By far, more relevant than most business books I have read	I began this book wondering how a centuries-old text could be applicable to twentieth century business negotiations.  I finished it wondering why modern business books are so irrelevant.  Rather than summarize, here are some of the jewels:   A leader leads by example, not by force.   The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.   Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.   Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.   There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.   The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.   When you move, fall like a thunderbolt.   Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.   Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.   When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Sun Tzu combines a startling humility with a stunning sense of responsibility.  He could not care less who gets the glories of victory.  He would prefer to be called a coward and win, then a hero and lose.  Sun Tzu's chief aim is not to fight, yet he bears the weight of his people's welfare on his shoulders.  To protect his people, he discipline himself and his troops mind, body and spirit until they cannot lose. In a world that prides itself on external victories, Sun Tzu's view of conquering the internal foe stands in stark opposition.

The book itself is quite short but the wisdom contained in it means that it is quite a dense book to read anyway. While we may now read The Art of War and think that we know most of the things, I imagine it was simply a monumental book back then. Even now some of the passages contain immense value and many principles still apply. The principles outlined in this book are not only applicable to ancient Chinese warfare but many can interpreted in the world today. While many of the principles regards itself on positioning and strategic decisions some other principles struck me as well. Principles such as: "To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself." and "Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays" are applicable to everyday life as well. This arguably makes it one of the rare books which transcend the domain in which it was once written in and shows us something that is fundamentally human and gives us the opportunity to improve ourselves.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Man of La Book	5.0	2012年6月28日 在美国审核	2	Profound Advice	The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an ancient Chi­nese mil­i­tary trea­tise. The book, a clas­sic within the sci­ence of mil­i­tary stud­ies is only attrib­uted to the high rank­ing gen­eral and was believed to have been com­plies dur­ing the last spring and autumn of the War­ring States period(either 476 BC or 453 BC). I first heard of The Art of War by Sun Tzu when I was in the mil­i­tary. I heard of the book in pass­ing and read a bit more about it when I got home, but never picked up a copy until sev­eral years later. The first thing which struck me was how short the book was, but the more I read, the more I real­ized the wis­dom behind the book. The sec­ond, third, forth and more I read this book I stopped for con­tem­pla­tion about what Sun Tzu's words mean to me, how I imple­mented his advice both in the mil­i­tary and out­side of it and the mis­takes I made, how can I learn from them and if I will repreat them again. But The Art of War is more than just about war. The book is about every strug­gle or con­fronta­tion, whether exter­nal or inter­nal. I can cer­tainly see how the advice applies to ancient war­fare, but when ana­lyzed, the book can apply to pol­i­tics, busi­ness and more. Sun Tzu under­stood, as any great leader/manager that the lead­ers set the tone and spends much of the book dis­cussing those qual­i­ties. This is true in any orga­ni­za­tion, the sergeants will treat the sol­diers the way the pla­toon leader treats them, who treat the sergeants the way the cap­tains treat them, etc. Mid­dle man­age­ment will treat their employ­ees the way upper man­age­ment treats them - so sim­ple, yet so profound. How­ever, the part that really struck home, for me, was when Sun Tzu speaks about know­ing your­self and your enemy.   "So it is said that if you know oth­ers and know your­self, you will not be imper­iled in a hun­dred bat­tles; if you do not know oth­ers but know your­self, you win one and lose one; if you do not know oth­ers and do not know your­self, you will be imper­iled in every sin­gle battle." Pro­found advice from a great gen­eral - one does not go into any com­pe­ti­tion with­out know­ing the oppo­nents. Ath­letes do not step onto the field with­out spend­ing house ana­lyz­ing every avail­able movie show­ing their oppo­nents at play and gen­er­als dis­sect enemy strate­gies to tiny details before form­ing their own.

It was easy and pleasant to listen to and the voices didn't detract from the information I was trying to soak in. This would be a good book to have a hard copy of or to reread several times to master all the principles and ideas presented within it. The Art of War was written by Sun Tzu, a Chinese general and war strategist 500 years b.c. It is a manual regarding war strategy and its main principles can be adapted for leadership, management and even parenthood in day to day interaction with others. I think it is a fairly useful concise book everyone should be introduced to. Here are the main points I liked from this book: 1. "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting." 2. "One may know how to conquer without being able to do it. " which leads into: Sun Tzu's emphasis on discipline, order, preparation and training. And the ability to know when to act and when to wait. 3. My favorite quote: "Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?" 4. "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle" 5. "The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent." 6. "We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors." 7. To obtain complete obedience and discipline you must administer ruthless punishment for disobedience on a regular basis. Small sacrifices are necessary for achieving the greater good. Yes, I cheated and copy and pasted these quotes off of google "art of war quotes" after listening to this audio version.  And if you don't have much time to spare even for listening than consider going through those quotes for a summary of the useful portions of the book.

Comparing the tactics and outcome of various battles and wars (past and present) to Sun Tzu's advice demonstrates that he generally knew what he was talking about and many (most?) of his principles still hold true. This translation made a serious effort to preserve the ambiguities present in the original, giving it a much more Eastern flavor than some older translations. I can't vouch for translation accuracy since I can't read the original, but Cleary at least sounds a bit more authentic than Giles (the "classic" English translation). The commentary sections sometimes gave insight into how "Master Sun" was understood by others over the next few centuries, but sometimes it was just a tedious unimaginative rephrasing of the original. On your first reading of The Art of War skip the commentary; it breaks up the flow of thought. (Also, don't bother with the 60 page intro unless you really want to hear the translator pontificate about Taoism for 50 pages while saying nothing that you can't pick up from the book itself) If you are interested in diplomacy, espionage, military tactics, etc. this is definitely a great read. Next time you watch a war movie or play a conquer-the-world type game you'll find yourself thinking in terms of The Art of War.

If you only know yourself, but not your opponent, you may win or may lose. If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself." The Art of War is the most prestigious and influential book on strategy that has ever been written. Sun Tzu showed how organizations can thrive in times of conflict and chaos by mastering five things: the way, the weather, the terrain, the leadership, and the discipline. Strategy is simply the art of making the right trade-offs. Everything we do in life has a cost-benefit. We must examine our choices and make the best one at each moment. Success is being the right person using the right tools in the right ways for the right cases at the right times for the right reasons. When I was 12, I wanted to enter West Point to become a general to lead and fight the greatest wars of my time. Yet, I began to realize that the biggest battles of this era were not between nations and man, but between health and disease. The world was crumbling with pollution, disease, hunger, fear, greed, violence, ignorance, and apathy. And these enemies would not be won by wars between men, but by revolutions within minds. These revolutions will not occur with the government, the education, or any social institutions. It will happen with businesses. This is the book that first connected me to my father. He told me that, "business is like modern day warfare." That always stuck with me.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Rorke Haining	4.0	2006年12月3日 在美国审核	3	Exactly what I expected	I'm a civilian, businessman, and fan of strategy games and movies.  I've wanted to read this work for years but never got around to it.  When a friend gave me this, the audiobook version, I finally did "read" it. Thoughts about the content: The work is surprisingly short, powerful, and rational.  The descriptions are poetic but to the point.  Some passages are brilliant and self-evidently true, some are harder to follow, but the entire work is engaging and worth reading/listening to.  One can see why it is required material for military strategists and why so many people have called it the most important reference work on the subject of war of all time.  One of the most striking aspects to me personally were the apparent logical contradictions.  Act honorably because the moral high ground is critically important to military success, yet deception is the essence of warfare and you must deceive your opponent.  You must follow these rules strictly otherwise you will fail, yet you must remain open to opportunity and adjust your tactics accordingly throwing out the rules.  This is not to say the lessons are false or difficult, but that there are thought-provoking dilemmas to be explored.  I was especially fond of the discussion of the roles of morality, economics, and spies in warfare, as well as several of the anecdotal side stories of ancient battles and strategems. Thoughts about the presentation/execution: Apparently, the most common and best English translation available translates not just Sun Tzu's original words, but also the work of an almost-as-ancient commentator who interspersed clarifications and illustrative anecdotes throughout the main text.  Note that this complicates an audiobook, a fundamentally linear form.  Textually, you can see that there is a tangent without breaking your flow (depending on how the text is formatted), deciding if and when to read the tangent.  In this particular case, some of the commentary is truly required in place (it just wouldn't be understandable to a 21st century American listener without it) and some would best be read outside the flow of the main work (such as the stories of ancient battles that illustrate one of the "bullet points" being made).  I believe the producers made the best possible translation from text to audiobook, and the readers chosen are top notch, but moreso than other audiobooks this work would just fundamentally work better as text, and for this reason I drop it to 4 stars.

This is the popular translation by Lionel Giles made even more popular by the introduction from the best-selling author of Japan epics, James Clavell. It contains Giles' commentary along with the translation. The annotations give historical examples of the strategies in action. Game theory is calculated strategy. The Art of War by Sun Tzu is probably the oldest and most important book on game theory ever written. It is the culmination of the development of the best warfare tactics prior to the 5th century BC. It is considered the foundation for all military plans and is still used to this day. It is most popular for its ability to win wars without fighting one. Its application has shaped the world as we know it. The Art of War can be understood as a breakdown of the chaos of warfare into components that can be analyzed and understood. The tactics are mostly about controlled organization, recognizing environments and situations and the correct response to each one. Organization is subject to change in competition. The Art of War is essentially the strategy of responding to changing environments. Response is thus relative to evolving conditions. 1 - "Laying Plans" The core message of this chapter is to calculate as much as possible before committing yourself. Important themes include discipline, ethics, environmental conditions and assessing the competition. It's about setting up the mission and evaluating the competition. 2 - "Waging War" The important detail of this chapter is to win as quickly and as economically as possible. Prolonged struggle means wasting resources and undermining confidence. When winning, use the spoils as rewards and capital. It's about making war pay. 3 - "Attack by Stratagem" This chapter is about deployment of the previous two chapters. The central message is to know thyself and know thy enemy. This stage indicates problems such as sieges, bad management and interior anarchy or legal/government interference. Advantages such as good management, exploiting opportunities and attacking tactics are covered. Strength is about cohesiveness and is independent of size. 4 - "Tactical Dispositions" This one stresses putting yourself in a position where you cannot be defeated and waiting for the opportunity to defeat the enemy. It is about recognizing the breaks and taking them as opposed to creating the breaks. 5 - "Energy" This part focuses on the power of deception to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and the use of spies to learn the enemy's moves. It also stresses the need to evolve in battle. It's about building up war capability. 6 - "Weak Points and Strong" This chapter encapsulates all the previous five chapters into an advanced war strategy producing outcomes, calculating and responding to events as they unfold. The strategies are developed here. It is about creating breaks. 7 - "Maneuvering" This deals with managing units and the internal problems they face on top of how to respond during movement to various circumstances. It is a chapter based on types of situations and responses. 8 - "Variation of tactics" This section expands on the evolution of tactics and strategies based on situations and responses but concentrates on what causes failure. 9 - "The Army on the March" This is advanced maneuvering especially across long distances with different terrains and how to deal with encounters. It is about interpretation. 10 - "Terrain" This describes the various terrains that an army can encounter and when and how to occupy them. It talks about distances, potential dangers and obstructions. Positioning is important. 11 - "The Nine Situations" This piece explains the condition of each terrain in terms of its tactical advantages and disadvantages and how to deal with both. It is a very intensive chapter because of the number of complex conditions dealt with. 12 - "The Attack by Fire" Arson in war is probably the single most troubling weapon that an army could have inflicted on the enemy around 500 BC. This chapter is obviously based on the most advanced weapons of the time which have since been developed. It is about using the principle of creating disorder and chaos to win. 13 - "The Use of Spies" Without spies don't war. War is won based on foreknowledge not by calculation but by direct information about the plans of the other side from spies. Spies are managed in this chapter. Even though the work is quite short (about 100 pages or less with commentary) it is complex enough to warrant several readings. It is the equivalent to learning how to play advanced chess, a game which compliments this study. There is a lifetime of thought within the pages. Napoleon was said to have used it and lost when he didn't follow it. The Art of War has become one of the most important self help books of this century popularized in big business as many executives have had recourse to this material because it offers a sound winning strategy. Most readers come away believing that the book's message finds it adaptable to many environments because it is all about adjusting to variations and so can be applied to anything and everything. The Art of War is not supposed to be an exciting read. It is a strategy book, a step by step guide to how battles are won and why they are lost. It is more to be memorized as a set of responses, including when not to respond, than to be understood. The combinations of the responses are unlimited. There is enough on the plate without asking why. Understanding why would come later and the answers to these questions would come from a very sophisticated understanding of the theory. It is an endeavor that remains open to the reader if they can come to terms first with the information that is here. Even if the book is not followed up on by subsequent study it can still leave a long lasting impression with its tips on discipline and achieving goals. It is great value for the amount of information contained in such a short burst. It will get you thinking strategically and that is more or less its claim to fame.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	John Matlock	5.0	2005年3月25日 在美国审核	5	A True Masterpiece, 2500 Years Old	The Art of War by SUN TZU is not fiction.  It's a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars (and business). It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles. The heart of Sun Tzu's thought is "All warfare is based on deception. Thus, when able to attack, we must seem unable. Hold out bait to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is quick to anger, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant." Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isn't. Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagon's Star Wars proposal. No one knew if it would work. But if it had, there was no way the Soviet Union could possibly have countered it. They didn't have the computer systems, and because of their closed society they didn't have the young kid genius programmers that we've developed in this country. Although there was an awful lot of complaining about Star Wars in the academic community in this country, it ended the cold war without a shot being fired.

This book has also been the "Bible" used to teach the winning principles of war down through the ages.Little ,if any, of the principles have changed,and if you look at any of the wars or battles over the centuries;you will see that the forces who won the wars,stayed true to these principles,while those who did not follow them were defeated.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	R. M. Straight	5.0	2010年3月13日 在美国审核	2	Classic for a Reason	Note: this is a LARGE PRINT edition. The Art of War (sun1 zi3 bing1 fa3 in pinyin with tone numbers, as Amazon doesn't like Chinese text), a book really more about recapturing peace than promoting war, despite its title, is still considered essential reading in the area of military studies. It is more than just ways to win; it's a treatise on humanity. There is not a single aspect of military positioning that Sun Tzu omits, something the Lionel Giles (this is a reprint of his 1910 translation) expresses wonderfully. There seems to be a frequent misconception that Tzu's work is somehow an Eastern version of Machiavelli's "The Prince." This could not be farther from the truth. One passage epitomizes this (again in pinyin): "gu4 yue1: zhi1 bi3 zhi1ji3, yi1bai3 zhan4 bu4 dai4; bu4zhi1 bi3 er2 zhi1ji3, yi1 sheng4 yi1 fu4; bu4zhi1 bi3, bu4zhi1 ji3, mei3 zhan4 bi4 dai4. gu4 yue1: zhi1 bi3 zhi1ji3, bai3zhan4bu4dai4; bu4zhi1 bi3 er2 zhi1ji3, yi1 sheng4 yi1 fu4; bu4zhi1 bi3, bu4zhi1 ji3, mei3 zhan4 bi4 dai4." My Chinese isn't great, but here's a basic translation: "one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not winning; defeating the enemy without battling is the pinnacle of victory." Whether you're planning on going into the military, need to replace your old, beaten-up copy, want to learn more about the Eastern mind, or just need a gift for an old veteran whose eyesight may be failing, this book is an essential addition to any bookshelf.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	C. Collins	5.0	2015年7月3日 在美国审核	0	A great anti-war book, which makes it a world classic	This highly regarded and ancient work has been translated by Thomas Cleary with more subtle thought than other wooden stiff translations.  In addition to Cleary’s introductory commentary, there are commentaries from 9 Chinese sages, philosophers, military strategists that followed Sun Tzu. These commentaries were written over many years after Sun Tzu and often add depth and perception to the original short text.  A strength of Cleary’s perspective is the relationship of this classic piece of literature with Taoism. The secret of this book is that it is actually an anti-war book.  Throughout the book Master Sun urges caution, patience, calmness, preparation, thought, reflection, intelligence gathering, and avoidance of rash impulse and anger. It is this quality of the work, the Taoist philosophy that underlies the strategy, which would make this book of great interest to the corporate world. Master Sun advises on how to prepare for conflict, how to avoid it if at all possible, but if engaged in an unavoidable conflict, how to move forward with the greatest chance of victory.  Make no mistake, Master Sun does not have a simplistic view of victory since he reminds us that territory defeated must then become territory held, a vast task that requires different tactics.  Master Sun spends much of his book in regard to assessment.  Assessment of your own strengths and capacities, assessment of the enemy’s strengths and capacities, the use of a range of different types of spies, and other methods of assessment are discussed.  Master Sun believes that the more fore knowledge the general has, the better he can develop a winning strategy.  This leads to a second theme throughout the writing of Master Sun which is the need to develop a strategy for action before taking any action.  If anything, the book warns against anger and rash action, but rather the development of a strategy and the assessment of the opponent’s strategy.  Another strength is that Master Sun tells us that having more troops, more forts, more weapons, etc. is no guarantee of success and that it is the cognitive aspects of warfare that can make the essential difference. It is difficult to compare this book to that of Machiavelli’s The Prince since Machiavelli’s book deals with armed conflict but also with political infighting and the brutal necessities of ruling and leadership. Because war is a dirty wasteful business, Master Sun’s book could be considered a great anti-war book since he warns against anger and revenge and places the center of warfare in the human brain, not in the heated emotions.

Even though Sun Tzu, if he existed at all, was roughly a contemporary of Homer and Isaiah, much of his advice seems pertinent today.  And, of course, the work is quite a window into Chinese culture and history.  The Kindle edition I read was initially published in 1910, translated by and including commentary by Lionel Giles.  Perhaps the oddest advice by Sun Tzu was for the general to keep his plans hidden from his own forces as well as those of the enemy; the most annoying characteristic (noted by Giles) is the typical Chinese approach of dividing a broad category (e.g., types of terrain) into a long list of subcategories that overlap but are not comprehensive.

Graham	5.0	2014年6月19日 在美国审核	0	The Art of War by Sun Tzu, Thomas Cleary	This ancient book of military strategy has been followed by military men and businessmen for thousands of years-two notable ones being Generals MacArthur and Patton. This work is attributed to Sun Tzu, a high ranking general in China about 5,000 years ago, though several other strategists are also quoted. Master Sun believed that war was a necessary evil, and must be avoided whenever possible. He felt like capturing an army or city intact was far better than destroying it. His book outlines 13 chapters of military strategy, covering everything from morale, use of spies, to position and timing.

I have looked at other volumes and I'm sure they have their positives, but for the average Jane or Joe who wants the essence of Sun Tzu this is the volume. I have given away dozens of copies to various students over the years that I buy used online. I also sell my honey and produce at a local farmer's market. I tell my students that business is legalized warfare. Again, Sun Tzu is there to give tips on product competition, pricing and grower reputation.

AP World History Book Review: Put honestly, I am a student using my parent's account who needs to write this review for a history class, but don't think that changes my opinion of the book. All in all, I found reading this book, or more accurately, treatise a thoroughly enlightening experience. Not only did it provide a rare insight into life back then through the eyes of a general, but it also manages an astounding feat which few other novels can accomplish: It is still accurate and relevant over two thousand years later. I will say that if your aim is to learn about the time period, there are better choices, but it was not written as a historical record. The general style feels as if it is simply giving you advice, and the fact that it is written in some sort of almost-second-person-but-also-kind-of-first-person style means that it feels like you’re having a conversation with Tzu. All things considered, I would certainly recommend reading this 2400-year-old military and political treatise.

I think it is a wise idea to read this Chinese classic from Thomas Cleary Translation. Had I encountered this from Archaic worded Japanese version I might not get so immersed into it. Cleary translation is really understandable even to non-native English speaker like me. Also it is great idea that the interpretation of notables including Cao Cao comes after the Master Sun's text. Comparing interpretation is really a fun. What I am impressed most about this book is it says that if you can avoid the war better not to fight. And its idea of how to manage an army is really close to modern idea of organizing groups particularly business corporations.

Keep in mind that Chinese language must be taken in its entire context, not seperated into individual characters and then translated word for word. What the translator has done in this case is equivalent to, for example, when English speakers say "Today, it rained cats and dogs", the translator automatically translated into "Today, it rained cats (as in the sense of house pet) and dogs (as in the sense of house pet)" instead of translating into "Today, it rained heavily". Another version of translation published by Publisher Cloud Hands (see Amazon [amazon.com/gp/product/0974201324])  seem to do a much better job than this version. So don't waste your money on this version.

This is a well-edited edition of Sun Tzu; the only aspect that left something to be desired was the inclusion of illustrative anecdotes; I would have preferred if they were left to the end of the chapter. I can understand why this book was a fad in the business world but object to claims that the tactics described in this book are easily applied to business.  This is a book about conflict, specifically, war, and there is much wisdom lost if it is taken out of its context.  There is much excellent advice for analogous situations; political persuasion and debate, games of Go, Shogi or Chess, or even sporting events. When taken from the world of conflict to the business, the realm of cooperation (in the sense that competing businesses compete to cooperate the best with their customers), The Art of War becomes yet another tome of "Eastern" sayings which sound pretty and can be "applied to any situation" only because they come to mean very little. Those who will be in a conflict situation or wish to prepare for one, even if it is a simple game of Go, should study this book.  Read the text and the anecdotes, and come back later to read it again gaining fresh insight.

There were two people on this page, who gave the book low ratings. After reading what they had to say, I can tell you that they don't understand "The Art of War", or how to apply it to our life today. You see philosophy isn't just books written to give you an easy path through life. No! Philosophy is meant to get the reader thinking and to take what was said and learned before and apply it to their life today. Sort of like what Bruce Lee said, "absorb what is useful". This means take what applies to your life, or what you can use in your life, and forget about the rest, it doesn't matter to you. I would recommend this book for those who are interested in Chinese history, military history, and philosophy. No matter what you are interested in, you won't go wrong by buying this book.

Barber	Joanna D.	5.0	2001年2月20日 在美国审核	303	A timeless classic that has practical application	I got this particular edition of Sun Tzu's Art of War at a strategy course for sales. I already had a copy of it at home, but this edition is so nicely done that I gave my old copy away and kept this one. The introduction of James Clavell is a nice touch. It is amazing to me that this book is not read in high schools or colleges in favor of Machiavelli's work (The Prince or The Art of War.) Sun Tzu's writing is clear and to the point. Unlike the popular Book of Five Rings by Musashi, this book is not metaphorical and poetic; it's downright practical. And it's not hard to read, unlike many classics. If you are doing business in China, this is also a good book to know. I mentioned some of the classic strategies while giving a course in China, and every member of the class had read it, knew it well, and gave me many examples from recent Chinese history where Sun Tzu's strategies were employed. This book is close to their hearts, and will give you insight if you are doing business in the East. Of course, the most famous anecdote from this book is about gaining the obedience of troops; the emperor, wishing to interview Sun Tzu for the commission of general, asked if Sun Tzu's military principles could be applied to women. Sun Tzu replied yes, the principles worked for women as well as men. Accordingly, Sun Tzu was given the task of organizing the emperor's many concubines into an army. Sun Tzu lined up the concubines and set the two favorites as officers at the head of the columns. He gave them a simple set of orders to march and drill (eyes front, right face, about face. The drums sounded and instead of following the commands, the girls simply giggled and blushed. He repeated the orders again, saying that if the orders were not clear, it is first the fault of the general. He repeated the commands, and the girls simply stood and giggled again.  "If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers."  Upon saying this, he ordered the two concubines at the head of the troop, favorites of the emperor, to be beheaded. The emperor hurriedly sent down the command to stop, he had no desire to see his favorites executed. The emperor said "We are satisfied that the general knows how to command." But Sun Tzu said, "Once having received the commission, there are certain commands I am unable to accept." And he ordered the two favorites to be beheaded. Once again, he gave the commands. The concubines marched, whirled about and drilled in perfect order.  The emperor appointed Sun Tzu general.

Product Review: Product casing; Case outside is paper with a sleeve inside containing the 2 CDs, but has room to store up to 4 CDs. Product itself; This new version gives readers spectacular ambience with the reading. 1) There are 4 voices within the reading. B.D Wong I believe is the younger sounding voice, his reading adds a little bit of Asian highlights giving more life to the books reading. Ron Silver I believe is the older sounding low voice, his reading adds a relaxing, clear understanding of the language and tone of the book. Both readers do a very good job. The other two voices read commentaries, quotes and questions. Stefan Rudnicki has a rugged voice deeper low voice. Shauna Zurbrugg is the only female voice and gives something different from the male voices. There sounds like a 5th voice at times, but no other reader is mentioned. 2) There is subtle music in the beginning/end of chapters; it would seem to be an Asian decent lullaby. 3) There is no static whatsoever, so it's truly a digital mastered recording. 4) The chapters are separated so you can skip to which chapter you want to hear. If you're trying to decide between the many copies of this book, I'd suggest this one if the price is the same or very close as you will be happy and satisfied. If a price is substantially different go with the cheaper one as most readings are very similar for this book in the two readers I have come across.

I was able to draw many parallels not only to the war situation of today, but also to the business world as well. I will admit that there were times that I thought the book was communicating more than I was receiving. While it is a short book, for the full impact to be felt, it is one that needs to be taken slowly and in short bursts in my opinion. Since the wisdom has transcended time, it truly is a classic.

Barber	Tyler P.	3.0	2008年3月25日 在美国审核	39	"Simple" Is Not Necessarily Code For "Profound"	Going in, my expectations were high -- The Art of War is praised as an all-time classic; equally applicable today as when it was first written; a philosophical insight into all manners of conflict, including business and (some have claimed) even romance! I did not find all of these things, here. Instead, I found a brief and simple outline of various battle tactics and tautologies, usually on the level of the field general. This is not to say that this is worthless, or that there is no way of taking the information and applying it -- via analogy -- to problems today. But I did not find it compellingly analogous to today's world, or no more so than any number of older works. The Art of War is a short, fast read. It is worth reading for its historical significance, and for a few insights that are not strictly obvious, and some of it may be applicable (with some mental stretching) to your quest to be promoted to the next level of management, or romantic victory over a rival, or whatever it is in your life that approximates "war." If other people find profound, life-altering depth in its lists of the types of terrain, or observations that it's better to attack your foe when they're tired, rather than well-rested, etc., then more power to them. I feel it's possible, however, that some of this depth lies more in the creative extrapolations of the reader than in the work itself.

Other reviews on the same page says enough about the edition and publication. The Art Of War by Sun Tzu is a precious material to study for military theoriees, decoding how people think and that certain period of acient Chinese history. I have read the original( Chinese version)and been taught some of it in high school. To get the most out of your interactions with others, this text will give you the tools to make things go your way. The text would teach you how to make a plan for anything in daily life and usually that plan would works if ur are basicly smarter than your opponents. You can consider yourself as a nation in the text, which makes your move in your work become the army in the text. Also socially relationships would be like politics or diplomacy in the book. However, In the acient wars between nations, there is no ethic. But you are the key to make it useful in a good way. I suggest audience of Sun Tzu to do a little research on Sun Tzu's private life. There were a lot of interesting events happened, knowing which will be a great help on understanding The Art Of War further.

For centuries, people have been referencing Sun Tzu to either contradict and justify or even glorify war. However, I think his most influential work responds only to an era that no longer exists and an era that we shouldn't keep on reviving. We must embrace a new system of thought or more applicable political theory.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	CMunson	3.0	2012年4月19日 在美国审核	10	Great insight into Chinese history, but limited practical use	The Art of War has in recent decades been applied to such modern day problems as politics and business - really anything where conflict can surface.  It was also suggested reading during my entire time in business school.  So, I finally pulled the trigger and read the "original" (or at least the most well-regarded translation) The Art of War.  The most impressive thing to me (which is explained in the introductory material) is how well the Chinese recorded their history.  My only complaint about the introductory materials was that most great Chinese historical figures have multiple names - this makes it hard to track who is who in some of the commentaries.  The actual strategies themselves are full of guidelines on determining your opponent's weaknesses, exploiting them and achieving victory.  Not exactly full of moral or ethical advice, so I can't use much of it.  I'm glad that I read it as it gave me a great look into Chinese history...but its practical use in my world is limited.

You can breeze through it in 5 minutes, but it was really meant to take a dose-a-day of it, ponder on the connection to your personal life and do your own interpretation. This is also why I particularly liked this edition, which doesn't include any notes, historical contexts, introductions etc. It really doesn't need any - the words speak for themselves if you just listen close enough... And it makes the book small and carryable in my bag for the right moment when I can take a sip of wisdom.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Steve Burns	5.0	2008年5月4日 在美国审核	127	Classic on the priciples of war	This ancient classic of 13 chapters was written over 2,500 years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu. It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals. It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe, and he lost when he broke its principles. The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy, business conflicts, and the day to day battles of life. Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages: Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance with out fighting. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Spies are the most important element in war, because upon them depends an army's ability to move. All warfare is based on deception. The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought. There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. In war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. (So they can retreat). Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained, fight not unless the position is critical. Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win. I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read. It is a must have for any home library. The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read.

It is a book to be read and reread, time and time again; focused, concerted and rich in understanding the nature and expression of resistance and conflict. Regardless of whether you are interested in deep confrontation, battle or war, this excellently edited edition will have something of interest for you. Published primarily for use in world philosophy and studied at military universities and academies around the world, this book is very constructive in providing a well researched, diversion sampling from one of the most important theorists in the field, Sun Tzu (544 BC - 496 BC). Although the philosophies contained in this text can be challenging at times, in the end the perceptive is absolute. As the seriousness of our global problems persist and even worsen, this book will continue to be a highly informative source of information for leaders and citizens for years to come. And for those who are looking for a more methodical approach to examining our relationship with the world, as opposed to the more publicized takes, this book will be especially valued.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Sameer Kak	5.0	2009年1月6日 在美国审核	3	the art of war for both ancient and modern times	Sun Tzu begins his treatise by saying that "The art of war is of vital importance to the State. A matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin." Sun Tzu says that the art of war is governed by five factors. These are: (1) The Moral Law - this causes people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives. (2) Heaven - stands for the seasonal conditions. (3) Earth - stands for the physical terrain ("distances great and small, open ground and narrow passes.") (4) The Commander - the virtues of the military commander. (5) Method and discipline - the marshalling of the army and its divisions (logistics, expenditure) Sun Tzu says that all warfare is based on deception. The objective of war is victory. Sun Tzu says that if the campaign is long-drawn-out, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain. Sun Tzu says that there is no instance of a country benefiting from prolonged warfare. Sun Tzu says that there is no merit in fighting and conquering. Merit consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting. Sun Tzu quotes the proverb "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat." Sun Tzu says that "The fighters must first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then wait for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by a mistake on the enemy's part." Security against defeat implies defensive tactics, and the ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive. Battles are won by committing no mistakes. Sun Tzu says that in war the strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas the one destined to defeat first fights and looks for victory afterwards! Sun Tzu says that in war the direct method may be used for commencing battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. There are only two methods of attack - the direct and the indirect - but in combination these give rise to an endless series of strategies. Sun Tzu says that one can be sure of success if one only attacks places which are undefended (weak points). On the other hand, the safety of the defense can be ensured only if one holds positions that cannot be attacked (strong points). Sun Tzu says that if one knows the place and the time of the coming battle, one can marshal one's forces from afar. Sun Tzu advices the general not to repeat the tactics (that have gained one victory) again and again. The way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak - like water, taking the line of least resistance. Sun Tzu says that maneuvering with a disciplined army is advantageous, but with an undisciplined multitude most dangerous. An army without its supply-train, without provisions and without bases of supply is lost. Forming a single cohesive body, it is impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. Sun Tzu says that it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Sun Tzu says that the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. Sun Tzu says that five faults must be avoided: Recklessness, Cowardice, A hasty temper, A (false) sense of honor and Over concern for one's troops. Sun Tzu says that if fighting is sure to result in victory, then the general must fight even though the ruler forbids it; if fighting will not result in victory, then the general must not fight even at the ruler's commands. The general must advance without coveting fame and retreat without fearing disgrace. Sun Tzu says that rapidity is the essence of war. And that the army must be kept continually on the move. Sun Tzu says that a spirit of enterprise must be cultivated if one wants to succeed in the attack and win the battle. Otherwise, war is just a waste of time and will lead to a stalemate. Sun Tzu warns that the general should be fully prepared for war - because a kingdom that has been destroyed can never again come into being, and the dead can not be brought back to life. For those interested in the study of war and war strategy, you can't do without this book...

Barber	Amazon Customer	2.0	2012年4月26日 在美国审核	3	Possibly Overrated Due to Pop Culture Popularity	Granted, most readers will find some wisdom in "The Art of War"; on the other hand, perhaps most of this "wisdom" is simply common sense dressed up in militaristic metaphors. I know that some of the popularity behind this book stems from the fact that plenty of its readers (usually male) are hip-hop figures, business types, and budding entrepreneurs. I'm sure the occasional gang leader took some leadership cues from Sun Tzu (was there really a Sun Tzu?) and this probably created an almost cult-like devotion to an "ok" book. I believe it's not quite one of the best leadership books ever, as some might suggest. Read it to relieve your curiosity, then delve into more modern tomes by folks such as Seth Godin or Guy Kawasaki if you're looking to start a business in today's world. In addition, you'll gain still more by reading biographies by one of today's business leaders.

I had just read The Prince by Machiavelli and really enjoyed it, but The Art of War was just less interesting in my opinion.  The most memorable part is early on when Sunzi demonstrates his leadership by training the king's concubines to obey the orders of a general.  That story is definitely worth a look.

It basically tells you how to win at war and it is fun just to read, but it is especially good if you want to win at something. It doesn't have to be war. Anything that requires strategy. It has much wisdom. I do have complaints though. In this print of it, there are far too many notes. one fellow said that this was the footnotes. That is not true. There is a ton of notes put in at the beginning, though, (many pages) so I can see how someone could make that mistake. It is a great book over all, but it doesn't need nearly as many notes as it has.

The idea is that actual war is a metaphor for the conflicts that one encounters in life and that the advice and tactics are just as applicable. Not really. This is a book about medieval Chinese warfare and by and large most of it is about precisely that, maybe ninety five percent.  If you want to find out how to get good at business, read a business book.  And if you want to get good at life, maybe get a self-help book.  If you are mostly interested in the history of the era, this is it.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Daniel Weiser	1.0	2014年8月5日 在美国审核	1	A Book about REAL WARS, Not about Negotiation Whatsoever	Being a negotiation specialist (and author on Amazon), I read the hardcopy of this book from cover to cover. It is true that the book is celebrated as a classic (written over 2500 years ago and still on the Amazon Best Seller List (Negotiation category) - WOW!! Probably the Bible alone was more popular). And it is also true (I checked) that this book had influence on mostly Chinese and Japanese negotiation styles in the later part of the 20th century (today – not really, see below). But if you want to read this book in order to actually learn negotiations from it - you couldn't be more wrong, with all due respect to Mr. Tzu. "The Art of War" is about - newsflash - how to battle your wars better (as in REAL wars). Tzu was a proclaimed Chinese General from the 6th century BC. His book gives the best advice to the audience he intended it to be for: combat Generals. He addresses issues like how to seize a fortress or city, the importance of information security, when is the best time to attack (answer: in the evening) and the likes. From reading it, it doesn't seem Tzu had ANY INTENTION of writing a book on negotiation and certainly makes almost NO REFERENCE to negotiations, in war or elsewhere. [for more on Sun Tzu - see here: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu#The_Art_of_War What raises the question – HOW was this book adopted by Japanese business circles in the 1970s and later by Chinese business culture? (yes, in that order). The answer is that the book DOES give several tips that – IN SPIRIT – apply to negotiations. For instance he discusses the importance of preliminary preparation before going out to battle (remember, he's talking about making sure the soldiers' weapons are intact). Does that apply to negotiations? – Absolutely YES; no doubt that a negotiator should be well prepared. But should he consider it a battle? Well, if you have done any negotiating with the Chinese or Japanese in the 90s, as I have, they possibly used to think that way, but today I feel that the climate has changed. Or let's take another pearl from the book: "Great warlords first win the battle, only then go out to combat". One would have to agree on that approach as well. But if you are a salesman, who just heard his customer say that "they need a 30% discount in order to even BEGIN negotiations on the deal" – how exactly is Tzu's insight helpful? To summarize, The Art of War is a great book for military strategy and tactics – as in West Point material. In modern business, however, I believe that seeing a negotiation as a combat or war will only cause loss of deals. The Chinese and Japanese are STILL skillful and tenacious negotiators, but their new generation of negotiators are more western oriented and probably never read this book. I could have passes myself.

It seems to me some of our recent contemporary U.S. "commanders" should have read this book before starting the Iraq war and taken its advise. This book is filled with strategy regarding conflict.  Some of the content is obviously way outdated.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Scott R. Dukart	5.0	2006年3月1日 在美国审核	590	An Excellent Translation of a Classic	The Art of War seems to be a classic piece of Chinese philosophy that is easy to translate into a mediocre work.  I've read a number of translations of Sun Tzu that are clunky and have none of the wit of the original text.  Now, I don't read ancient Chinese, but when a Chinese philisophical text reads like a manual for a microwave, you know something is lost in translation. On the other hand, this translation, done by Thomas Cleary, showed me the subtlety in the Art of War.  In addition to the work itself (which would make a very thin book) there is a long, interesting introduction written by the translator which I found very helpful in thinking about the Art of War, as well as helping to put the work in both a historical context, and the context amongst many of the other ancient Chinese philisophical works.  How Sun Tzu's work relates to Taoism is very interesting.  Also, there are selected commentation on each of the paragraphs of the Art of War.  These commentaries were written over different periods of time by different Chinese philosophers.  These help to show how many different points of view can exist over a single statement made by Sun Tzu. I find this translation very well done, and I can easily recommend it to anyone who wants to read The Art of War.

This edition was published by Filiquarian Publishers and from a publishing perspective, this book appears to have been designed in a basic Word processing program. Shoddy, shoddy, work. Lacks creative design, weak choice of fonts, inconsistent spacing, erroneous punctuation symbols, etc. Additionally, one of the chapters was out of order. I'm speculating that the publisher didn't know how to read roman numerals and therefore placed the chapter incorrectly, and if they did, and there was a purpose for this, it should have been addressed in the non-existent introduction. The content of the book is fine, just buy an edition by a an established publisher rather than someone working from their basement.

Let's have women's equality now . . . everywhere. No wonder we have had centuries of wars. War is not the only solution, but it is all too often the knee-jerk reaction of a sexist society with like-minded male leaders in charge. Even though this book represents thinking from long ago, it still reflects the sexist, combative male psyche and primal need to dominate rather than cooperate which is still fostered and rewarded in business today. It explains why women do not get ahead in business after countless years and many decades of demonstrated ability and superior management skills.  The master's house will not be destroyed with the master's tools. This book is a sad reflection on life.

It is not that the writer is wrong about most subjects (though a lot is hopelessly outdated). The problem is that any 12 year old who has played with toy soldiers enough, could have written this book, without the fancy words or synonyms. Don't attack when outnumbered, with the sun in your face etc etc. The very basics of battles, not even of warfare. True warfare, now and then, relies more on logistics with the battles being just a small part of war. So if you are completely ignorant of battles and war and simple logic you can read this book and be satisfied. However if you are truely interested in the "art of war" then read the book with that same name from Machiavelli.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Kindle Customer	4.0	2021年1月23日 在英国审核	1	The Art of War, reviewed by Tevin Gongo	Of course that is a classic. I have to say that I feel a little uncomfortable with the concept of always thinking about winning the battle. I can appreciate the benefits of mastering those principles for anyone engaging in battles (politics, economics, socials...) but unless it is the last option, I prefer to engage with others thinking win-win. I will certainly read that book a few more times this year and in the years to come. As a classic, it is worth reading it, as for its daily use, I guess it is needed to read it over and over so it gets easier to really understand the principles and understand how to apply them correctly in our everyday life.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	BartmanSA	5.0	2020年9月30日 在英国审核	0	Excellent summary	The kindle version has some formatting issues but forget about that. The key here is that the rules of war are set very well. In essence, war is about strength and strength comes in many forms, not just numbers. The book explains how to measure strength and this applies to your enemy as well as yourself. If you are strong, pretend to be weak. If you are weak, pretend to be strong. As a rule, nobody attacks a foe whose strength is unknown so if you remain a mystery to your enemy, they are unlikely to attack. Such an interesting read with great examples from history. Recommended reading.

No one knows exactly when The Art of War was written but it was collected around the 10th Century CE. Regardless of your interest in military strategy, this short collection of proverbs and idioms is worth the time it takes to read. The lessons can be broad and universally applied to daily life, especially in business and career terms.

Barber	Karl Manderson	5.0	2020年2月5日 在英国审核	0	Lovely book	Got the B&N Leatherbound pocket edition of this book, the book is presented beautifully and feels very well made unlike some other B&N Leatherbound editions, this one feels far more substantial and the leather a bit thicker. Sewn pages and thick binding make this feel great in the hands. This edition is definitely my favourite choice of the Art of War

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Dr. Swijghuisen Reigersberg	1.0	2015年12月21日 在英国审核	3	Not recommended.	The formatting for this Kindle version is terrible and the academic narrative jumps from one thread to another, without much explanation of the scholars, characters and time frames involved. It really did not provide me with what I was after: a clearly contextualized narrative of The Art of War. Thankfully this purchase was cheap.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	T. Clarke	5.0	2016年6月8日 在英国审核	1	One of the best things I've ever read.	In case you're expecting a thick tome, or a novel: it's basically a super-thin, super-simple pamphlet guide. That being said, it's riveting. Each "lesson" makes you stop and think, and while I'm not a very philosophical or meditative person, I found myself musing on the various rules of war, and how they apply to my personal and professional life. A bargain buy!

First of all, it is extremely short- you will polish it off in a single sitting for sure. Secondly, I can see how some people suggest this for modern times, however I personally would not. The book is too focused on actual battle and very high level tactics. It would seem that many of the other similar but more targeted books in this category would do a better job for what I was looking for.

Now talking about the book I think it's the most overated book that I have read so far.  So my suggestion would be not to waste time on this. It is written point wise that also for me seems a little childish. It talks about different tactics of warfare which is completely irrelevant in today's time. One atom bomb and all your Art of War would go in vain. I though of giving it 2 stars but the reviews that is there on the cover of the book is so very good that it made me give it 1 star. Also comparing it with Gita is complete insult to human civilization. Rest I would say if you have a lot of time and want to waste it and get angry after few days then I would suggest you to go for this.

16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Bhasamrita Sarmah	5.0	2019年3月13日 在印度审核	5	A very very very useful book	It's the 2nd Gita/ Quran / Bible/ Granth Sahib (whatever is yours)! And if you want to be successful in any field then this book will fire up your mind. But let me tell you one thing...... It's a book that basically gives you instructions, instructions on how to fight a war and win. It's not that kind of book that makes every instruction simpler by explaining it with a lot of examples (It makes sense when you consider the fact that it was written by Sun Tzu thousands of years ago). It's just the instructions...... That's it. So you may find it a little difficult to relate it to circumstances in your life. So while reading the book, power on your creative mind and try relating each instruction to your everyday use. I bet it's going to be a brainstorming session and what's more..... You'll love it!!

Barber	Dewa	4.0	2020年7月7日 在澳大利亚审核	1	A mind stimulating book but a gem to say the least	So i read this book a number of times before i finally began to decode it, and well safe to say its full of gems. I'm not a very manipulative person by nature but have had many run ins over my short life span with people of this nature, which has very much contributed to myself being trod all over. Reading this book really put into perspective many aspects of human behaviour and well quite frankly highlighted the characteristics of a narcissist and potential methods to counteract it. There are many scenarios in the book which I don't see myself using however being new to the business world, i definitely know that i will be revisiting the book numerous times. To put it simply, take this book with a grain of salt and interpret it as you wish but regardless of the extent to which you relate to it - simply learning of the true essence of war makes it an interesting read nonetheless! Also regarding the product - it is quite thin and condensed, i wish there was more room to annotate it as i was cramming sentences between lines by the end of it, and a book of this sort definitely needs annotation 😅 but it did arrive fast and as pictured! a steal for the price!

If you are familiar with war terminology and scenarios then definitely go for this book but if it's your first book in the domain of strategy building and decision making then go for the book with explanation of each tactic given in simple language and analogy, many of these books are available on Amazon itself.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	M. Dowden	5.0	2012年12月19日 在英国审核	9	The Classic For All	You may be wondering why I have picked such a title for this review, and there is a very good reason for it.  Written well over a thousand years ago Sun Tzu's tactical guide to war is still used and taught in military schools, and has found more applications over the centuries. The tactics laid out here were used in historical battles fought in Asia and China but they were also used by Ninja's and intelligence services.  Nowadays still used by the military and intelligence worlds they have found a place in business.  Why this is so is firstly because it isn't long to read, it isn't hard to read, and it is reliable information.  If you use a bit of thought then you can apply the teachings of Sun Tzu in your life, as and when necessary.  Of course although being short this does make you use your brain and think, and this in itself can make you come up with ideas how to apply the teachings here.  This is a must read for those who study  military tactics, and military history, as well as businessmen, and those who want to be one step ahead of the game.  Ultimately this is the classic for all, and hopefully can help you in unforeseen ways, and in many situations.

However, few points are very contradicting to the actual meaning in the book.

Thanks to Amazon and the seller for quick delivery and reasonable pricing.
16	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	Brace E. Barber	Ham-Bap	4.0	2017年7月26日 在英国审核	21	More in-depth than other versions	This is probably one of the best versions of the Art of War i've seen anyway. It basically gives some analysis and goes into depth on what Sun Tzu means, using some ancient Chinese commentators as references and examples to better explain the teachings. I would have given this 5 stars but it's layed out strangely. You'll find pages with 1 sentence that seem continue on the next page, but it's tolerable given the depth which the researcher explains things. I have 3 different versions of the Art of War. One is a thin 50 page pamphlet, the second has some artwork included but this version includes more than just Sun Tzu's teachings on certain topics. As a result it's more enjoyable to read than a list of bullet-points, and much more informative.

In my opinion, the book would have been better though if it was translated in a slightly more modern way. Nevertheless, it is still a very good book. I think that one of the strong points about this book is that it's contents is very well organised which makes it easier read, as opposed to other translations out there where the contents of the chapters are poorly structured & are mixed along with some comments made by someone else, not by Sun Tzu! which for me, can get pretty annoying...

People will always disagree, but getting through the disagreement without the massive collateral damage that goes with conflict is a much undervalued approach. Sun Tzu offers insightful advice to help master those anxieties, manage your resources towards peace of mind and to end disagreement in the most decisive and holistic manner possible so that life can return to it's normal routine of tea and cake. He may be cunning, shrewd, devious and even ruthless, but without his no-compromise approach to obtaining peace, well.. you may well find out why one should never fight a land war in asia!

A work in translation. I suspect much has been lost in translation, but the book is centuries old, so it may be dated now. I'm not sure as I'm not a military person and so may not be the best person to review this book. I thought it would apply to business. Some very clever points in it, though, and I am aware this book is a classic of its kind. Well known, especially by scholars.

Like buses that all seem to come at once, this is YET ANOTHER version of the Lionel Giles' 1910 version without the rather heavy original footnotes or the mildly useful Giles introduction. It's actually in quite readable English for the date, and seems reasonably understandable in the 21st century. I've no idea on the accuracy of the translation. Opening line from other Giles versions: "Sun Tzu said: the art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected." Prices vary considerably but the words stay the same. Update: after clattering through all the Kindle samples, this is the one I chose, because it's the cheapest, AND I can always read the original introduction by getting a sample download from another version. Simples!

18	西游记	The Journey to the West, Revised Edition, Volume 1	吴承恩	Anthony C. Yu	Brian Tung	5.0	2016年7月26日 在美国审核	110	A carefully crafted rendition of a Chinese classic	[The Journey to the West (西遊記) is so well-known a story in Chinese culture that I won't bother to review the story as such, but will focus on the translation.  This book is the first volume of a four-volume translation.  This review covers all four volumes.] Any translation of a literary work, let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are, is an exercise in compromise and cleverness.  A particular sentence in Chinese—even a single phrase—can be rendered in numerous ways in English, each one of them carrying a different set of nuances.  To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.  That is the compromise.  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole. It is said that one should always translate into one's "A language"—that is, the language in which one is most fluent.  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker, and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English, it was still not his primary language.  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original. Something must be done with those nuances, though.  Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work, as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yan's Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.  But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist, Daoist, and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence.  So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.  Included also are scholarly citations that justify, with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader, all the various word and phrasing choices he made.  In some cases, Yu's study has even found errors in the original text. The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story, Wu Cheng'en's presumed authorship, biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel, and Wu's motivations for writing it, and them, the way that he did.  These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu.  Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English, but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard.  A must have for the dedicated reader.
18	西游记	The Journey to the West, Revised Edition, Volume 1	吴承恩	Anthony C. Yu	Mary Soon Lee	3.0	2017年9月9日 在美国审核	26	One of the four great Chinese classics. I found the introduction tough, but the story itself often fun.	"The Journey to the West" is a lengthy 16th century novel, regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature. The author of the book is uncertain, but is thought to be Wu Cheng'en. This volume contains the first twenty-five chapters of the hundred-chapter narrative, plus extensive notes and a ninety-six-page introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu. I found the introduction a difficult read, no doubt due to my prior ignorance about almost everything it covered. But the introduction was helpful, and I am glad I labored through it. The book itself defied my expectations. It was neither dry, nor dense, nor inscrutable. To my surprise, it appears to have been intended to be fun, and, despite the intervening centuries, I often found it such. The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before "The Journey to the West" was written. In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights. There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry, serving both as description and commentary, and the poetry lightened the reading. Since this volume contains only the first quarter of the story, I will postpone further comments for now.

He read a couple of pages to me, and it put me to sleep. Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenth-century Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzang’s journey to acquire scriptures in India. Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation. Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker. Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story. Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven. According to my husband, who read every word of the four volumes including the footnotes, the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism.

I've read Journey to the West, Yu's translation, every few years for the last decade or so now. It's wonderful, and improves with every reading. There are layers of meaning, and I really appreciate Yu's scholarly footnotes. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is a bit of a mess. The Chinese characters are FAR too small to read (they're smaller than the smallest-size font, and can't be resized). This is extremely frustrating, since much of the word-play, and some of the important concepts hinge on the characters used. This needs to be fixed. I'd say, if you haven't read Journey to the West, read it. But stick with paper for the time being.

18	西游记	The Journey to the West, Revised Edition, Volume 1	吴承恩	Anthony C. Yu	Laszlo Hopp	4.0	2013年9月19日 在美国审核	16	A unique ancient story where the sidekick is the undisputable hero	I read the four-volume revised Kindle edition of this book, translated by Anthony C. Yu. The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a 7th century Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, during the Tang Dynasty. He undertook his famous, nearly two decade-long pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India. When he returned to China, he translated many of the original texts to Chinese, thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism. Some of the pilgrim's original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near today's Xian. The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the (Handsome) Monkey King. Through various twists and turns, he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book. Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang - in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the 3 original Buddhist scrolls - from the Emperor's palace, the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk. In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples: Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo. To complete the mystical traveling company, a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitaka's deceased horse. The bulk of the story is the description of the group's arduous traveling through impenetrable forests, burning mountains, and dangerous rushing rivers. They encounter countless demons, spirits, monsters, dragons, and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka. This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs. With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk. For the contemporary reader, the story has a few stumbling blocks, not the least of which is the length of almost 2400 pages. In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters. The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story. One can skip these paragraphs however, without losing much from the narration. For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book. In my rough estimation 15-20% of the text may well be poetry. The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of, or clarifications to, the main story. As such, they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature, the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion. In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters' inner selves. I skimmed through many, but not all poems. Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details, will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book. Of the four characters, the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not 3 but 4 stars to this book. He is an absolute riot; a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of self-adoration, self-assuredness, mischief, steadfast loyalty, courage, wisdom, practicality, and, on the top of everything, a great sense of humor. Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story: The Great Sage Equal to Heaven. Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings, the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed. Although the Tang Monk is formally the lead-hero of the story, he really pales in comparision to the Monkey King. He is the most benevolent, spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind. Unfortunately, he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King. Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen. He is stupid, yet quite capable in many ways. His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified, however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the high-minded Tripitaka. The character of the third disciple, Sha Monk, is far less complete than the previous three and doesn't deserve particular attention in this review. Overall, the book in its full length is not an easy read. I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world, namely the Tang Dynasty, from the perspective of a much later, but still very old, time, namely the late Ming Dynasty. What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure! An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest. Additional information: The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies, TV shows, stage plays, and comics. I saw one of these adaptations, Alakazam the Great. This Japanese cartoon film, although adorable in its own right, in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story. I've also read the Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein. The book adds a unique, modern-time perspective to this ancient story.

This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture, and it gave me a familiarity with one of China's most beloved folk tales.

Nonetheless, Yu's translation reads differently enough and the complete series of events is captivating enough, that I had no desire to skip straight to Volume 2.  I wish I had had the good sense to just read a complete translation the first time.  I even find Tripitaka ever so slightly less awful thanks to Yu's introduction which offers some historical background. I thoroughly enjoyed the volume.

The book contains a lot of helpful footnotes explaining some of the lesser known cultural references. The story itself takes a lot of time to get going, but if you can motivate yourself to keep reading you are treated to a journey, equal to that of the oddysey, even if Tripitaka is annoying to say the least.

The introduction is a lil long but necessary to understand all the history and allegories that the story has, as Daoism, Buddhism & Confucianism. So isn't a children story as a lot of people used to see it..but a a TRUE literary work.

I fell in love with this story when i was a little kid, watching the japanese tv show from the 70s called 'monkey'. i love that show.. it is awesome. when i was in primary school, i read an english abridged version of the journey to the west. it enjoyed it, but i always wanted to read the full story. but i cant read chinese so i was never able to. until today, when i found out that a full unabridged english translation of it had been completed and available to purchase this year!  I bought all four volumes of this immediately on my kindle.. and I felt so great having the complete novel on my kindle, ready for me to read at my leisure.  I wanted to write this review to thank Anthony Yu, who i read spent 6 years translating this novel.  I am so thankful!  Thank you Mr Yu!

Yu	Florizel	3.0	2017年9月28日 在美国审核	4	Inferior in readability to Waley's version (published under the title "Monkey")	This is a quite stilted "professor's translation" of a classic work of literature. I can't read the original, but since this was popular writing in its day, it's hard to believe it is anything like this in the original. I discovered Arthur Waley's version (published under the title "Monkey") after I bought this, and I regret the purchase. I find it unreadable. The good doctor is to be commended for his exhausting effort to translate the entire work, which Waley did not undertake. But Yu has merely a good student's grasp of English, and writing literary English is beyond his powers, while Waley at his best has real gifts. I'd recommend this translation only if you simply must have the entire work.

Yu	NeverneverLand	4.0	2014年3月1日 在美国审核	7	Good translation, though lacking in brio	I read this translation together with the Chinese original, the authoritative Renmin Wenxue Chuban Se edition (third edition, released in 2010). My overall impression is that this translation is well done. Prof Yu strives to translate every single character, so the minor flattening-out found in the Jenner version isn't found here. However, at the highest level of criticism, the translation lacks a little of the brio and fun found in Waley's highly abridged "Monkey". Yu's somewhat slavish adherence to the original text yields dividends, yet at the same time sacrifices a bit of the verve. I found myself preferring to read the Chinese despite it being more difficult (a feature of the somewhat abstruse vocabulary). Another point to note is that the original writer has a very wide vocabulary, which isn't that noticeable in Yu's translation (he tends to tone down some of the more difficult words). Nonetheless, Yu's version must remain the best translation of "Journey to the West", though I won't say it's definitive like Moss Roberts' "Three Kingdoms" version for "Sanguo Yanyi". What is really splendid about this edition is a lengthy and scholarly introduction which helps lay readers understand the Daoist and textual background of "Xiyouji", and Yu's book may be recommendable for that alone.

At the end of close to 3,000 pages I said to myself, "I'm never going to have to read another novel because nothing out there now will ever touch this work of art." After perhaps an 18-year novel reading hiatus I picked up the habit again, but still in light of The Journey to the West, I really don't know if it is worth the time and money. Over time those volumes slipped away as once-read books tend to do and so I bought this, and plan to buy the rest, just to keep them close and occasionally read a chapter or two at bed time to my wife.

I've known about Journey to the west since I was a kid, it's deeply popular in asian culture. I've seen 3 different tv shows about it. If I had read this book before watching those shows, I would've thought Journey to the West was awful. The translation is extremely dry. I think it would've been better if the author took liberties and wrote the story himself rather than do a direct translation. If you are really interested in this story, watch a subtitled version of the tv show. There's not much to be had in these translated books.

It is long: I've seen the statistic that it is twice the length of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Be prepared to navigate your way through the tricky to translate metaphors in the poems, characters who use a wide variety of names and a narrative structure unlike anything a present day Western reader is expecting. Also be prepared to discover endearing characters, beautiful word use and a sense of humour and fun that defies time and cultural divides, assisted by a very thorough, accessible and beautifully written translation by Anthony Yu. When I wasn't too engrossed in the story, the footnotes at the back provided an excellent explanation of what various turns or phrase refer to and lead me to learn so much about Chinese mythology and history. While I expected that it would be a long slog to get through the first volume, I found I'd read it very quickly. Now the only thing holding me back from continuing the journey is having to purchase the next volume! As a PS, someone who is starting to read should try keeping a "Xuanzang falls off his horse" count. He seems to do it quite frequently, made me giggle every time...

This is the second volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, "The Journey to the West." As with the first volume, it is quite different than I'd originally anticipated. Far from being a dry, difficult, worthy tome, it is filled with taunts, trickery, battles, monsters, and a generous helping of poetry. The narrative is episodic and repetitive, but connections between the various events help thread it together. I had intended to read a chapter a day, but was often tempted into more. Although there is a great deal of violence, the tone is very light. Suffice it to say, I didn't expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water. A radical concept: literature is allowed to be fun.

This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows.  The characters are very popular.  I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic.  This is one of the four volumes translated by the author.  The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture.  The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetition--based on how the stories were told over the ages.  A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumes--but the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes.

This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  It is, I believe, the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text.  Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture. Do not let this discourage you as you read, let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original. Seeing it via one of the many movies / TV productions available is a great help in enjoying this work.  I highly recommend the CCTV production from mainland China done in both 1986 and 2000.

1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	Zachary Littrell	5.0	2018年3月17日 在美国审核	59	Sprawling, funny, aggravating, and heartbreaking masterwork	Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding "Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad." ...ah! I love learning about other cultures! But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly ("Who the heck is this person again?" I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time. Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him). But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work.... ...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	David DE	5.0	2020年9月17日 在美国审核	9	The DEFINITIVE English translation of "Story of the Stone" (aka "Dream of the Red Chamber")	What can I say about "Story of the Stone" that hasn't already been said? It is truly one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature and I have spent nearly twenty years of my life reading and studying this incredible book, in both English and Chinese. Having read both multiple times, it should be said that David Hawkes' translation of the first three volumes if exceptional. While I don't agree with every decision he made as a translator, he always had a reasonable explanation (I've also seen his translator's notes, which is available in book form from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Press or available online for free). For example, I'm not sure about his changing of colors (e.g., "Dream of Golden Days" instead of "Dream of the Red Chamber"), but I understand why he did it, and he makes a very good case for it. What makes this translation truly exceptional (and the reason it is so much better than the English "translation" by Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang) is because it can stand on its own as a work of literary art. Hawkes' masterful prose makes the reader feel like the book was originally written in English (despite the content letting you know that it's a very different world) because of how smooth and stylish it is. He is able to not only convey the words, but the mood, tone, and feel of the book, which is very hard to do, especially with something so complex as "Story of the Stone." He took some liberties with the translations of some of the poems (of which there is a lot in this novel), but they flowed naturally in English while still retaining, by and large, their original meaning and intent. Again, that is not something easy to do, not to mention his ability to handle nearly 300-year-old Chinese humor and 'playfulness' of word games and subtle foreshadowings. David Hawkes is clearly one of the most exceptional (if not THE most exceptional) translator of Chinese literature into English that I have ever encountered. His "Introduction" in Volume I is also one of the best overviews of the novel ever written. Of course, the novel itself, translation aside, is sheer brilliance. Its vast scope, ability to engender so many different (and genuine) feelings in the reader, all of the ups and downs. It could be said that Cao Xueqin writes like a painter. His insane attention to detail and description makes the reader feel like they are really there, standing in that elegant and opulent mansion or in Prospect Garden. It is said, though, that to truly start to understand "The Story of the Stone," you have to read it at least five times. I would also strongly suggest that those who fall in love with this novel, as I have, spend some time looking for other scholarly books and articles related to the novel, because there are so many complex layers involved, and you may even find a greater sense of closure (particularly if you don't read the last two volumes, which were a forgery, not written by the original author of the first 80 chapters, who had a quite different ending in mind).
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	BAG	5.0	2020年2月14日 在美国审核	4	The translation is flawless and makes it easy to read.	This story in Volume one revolves around several upper class families and shows the high level of etiquette required among family members.  The English translation is seamless and becomes beautiful in the way poetic couplets of two or more lines are presented. One meaning of the book is that it is a remembrance of the past. This seems to refer to the lives of various princely families in Nangking during the early 18th century before they were punished by the Emperor. The Chinese author was a member of these families. The original in Chinese was printed in January of 1792 and has become one of the most famous pieces of Chinese  literature. A knowledge of Chinese culture and history would no doubt increase the readers appreciation for the quality of this book.

Anderson	5.0	2011年1月8日 在美国审核	56	China's greatest novel	This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China ("Red Studies," from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, "A Dream of Red Mansions"). It really should be read by every educated person.   The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however.   I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature.   The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note.   First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women).   Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses.   Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead.   Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure.   Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others.   There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.   Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia.

For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West (Americas, Europe) it might be a chore to get interested in this book. The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you. If you're interested in how life was lived in that part of the world, this book will be a masterpiece, as it has been in China itself.

The family compound. Relation between relatives and the pecking order. The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs. Subjection of women is rife, but not without protest. This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived.  This is not a history book, it is a novel of customs, more about  what people thought, about respect, subservience and privilege  and mores.

The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read).

It is an exquisite blend of history, fantasy, magical realism, reality, riddle and of course Chinese philosophical witticisms. There are more than 550 characters in The Story of the Stone and many with very similar names. You must get familiar with at least 50 of these characters because they are not bit players. The plot(s) are intricate but not particularly hard to follow and the pace of reading is quite brisk and easily understandable. That in itself is an accomplishment since the story takes place in China around 250 years ago and revolves around lifestyles and customs that I would imagine that most Westerners are unfamiliar with. I actually read a review where someone compared this book with Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann. I don't know about that, but the overview of the book is that it is about the decline and fall of two families. It is a highly enjoyable book.

The Story of the Stone) composed by Cao Xueqin. It generally considered as one of China's Four Great Classical Novels. It was written sometime in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty, and the setting of the story is early in the 18th century. This book was selected by Great Books KC group as our exposure to non-western literature for the year 2016. At the time Dream of the Red Chamber was selected for our schedule we didn't realize how long the complete work is. The Story of the Stone (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by John Minford, consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices). Total page count is 2,572. Our group decided to limit our discussion to the first volume as a more manageable reading assignment. I have no intention of completing the other four volumes any time in the foreseeable future. It's my understanding that the complete story is about the beginning grandeur and eventual decline of the aristocratic Jia family clan. As indicated by its title, The Golden Days, this first volume is focused on the beginning prosperous years. The book provides a detailed insight into wealthy Chinese cultural life of the time and the story's narrative includes frequent use of poetry. But this novel lays out a sprawling story line with numerous characters with names impossible for western readers to remember or pronounce. This is combined with excruciating details which at times can be beautiful, but overall becomes a heavy forest of words for the reader to slog through. Frankly, I didn't appreciate the experience very much. If I feel this way after the first volume I hate to imagine how I would feel should I manage to complete all five volumes.

Dream is amazing and I'll leave my commentary on the actual novel itself there. David Hawkes did a good job, but his translation is lacking in many ways. Dream is full of puns and other language/character specific nuances. Much of the deep irony and symbolism is lost in limp and at times flippant name translations and confusing reproductions of titles that can easily leave the reader scratching their head. His choice to translate from a combination of texts provides perhaps too many opportunities for translating to become editing and revision. Still a good buy if you have no investment in Dream as anything but a cool novel someone told you about, but for those seeking a closer reading, it would be best to at least have a Chinese version at hand for comparison.

I am neither Chinese nor a Chinese scholar, as most of the reviewers seem to be.  My only experiences with Chinese literature heretofore are Ezra Pound's translations of poets such as Li-Po and other much older poets from the Tang Dynasty period.  Thus, my approach to the book has consisted of that of a lover of Western literature dipping his toe into what all seem to regard as THE masterpiece of Asian literature.  I'm sorry if my review disappoints or rankles the devotees of this book.  On the other hand, it was my experience in reading this first volume and the review remains truthful to it. First, I do concur that this volume was obviously a labour of love by English translator David Hawkes.  Indeed, I actually found his Introduction much more interesting than the book as a whole.  He goes well out of his way in both the Introduction and the Appendix to make things as easy on the English reader as possible.  Nevertheless, with 500+ characters and (according to both Hawkes and the Chinese reviewers/translators here) altogether too many puns and wordplay for the translator to convey them all, he is rather swimming against the tide.  Also, the turns of phrase and vocabulary employed by Hawkes are very British and quite archaic; and, whilst this was quite enjoyable to me, being a native of England and a lover of its literature, it does rather skew one's experience of reading it.  At times, Bao-yu and his feminine entourage come across as precocious flâneurs or "bright young things" - a phrase Hawkes actually employs - of Interwar Oxonian vintage. Be all this as it may, Cao Xueqin, or whoever wrote the first chapter (as this seems to be in scholarly dispute) anticipates my reaction to the book, in the form of the Stone in disquisition with Vanitas, from which I quote in part: "I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time; I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy." On the other hand, Mr. Stone, Vanitas might have replied, "It may not prove so."  It certainly did not with me, for various reasons.  It is not an unpleasant read.  There's a sort of shimmering, limpid quality to the characters and the setting.  There are even some pearls amidst the paste in the translated poetry, such as: "In vain we roam: Each in the end must call a strange land home." Or: "Heaped charnel-bones none can identify Were golden boys and girls in days gone by." But, to sum up, what is missing in all the courtier-like atmosphere and sycophantic poetics in most of this book is any sort of tension, or suspense, or, most of all, any sort of inner life at all.  Several reviewers here mention Shakespeare in comparison to Xueqin.  I simply can't imagine any of the famous soliloquies occurring in the work, or any intense focus on the inner travails of the individual which make him or her so much more important than the milieu in which s/he is situated.  Herein, everything is milieu.  A pleasant, interesting milieu, granted; but it's still mere milieu. I am full willing to grant that I may be missing something due to translation, or some idiosyncratic defect of my own, but I simply can't see, judging from this first volume, how this work can be considered great literature.
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	Liz	5.0	2015年12月24日 在美国审核	0	One of the greatest	At the age of 19, I was involuntarily compelled to read an abbreviated translation of this novel (Dream of the Red Chamber). I remember how surprised I was to find that I enjoyed the experience. Life went on, but I thought of the book many times, and while recovering from surgery at the age of 40, it struck me that a re-read might speed me back to health. How lucky I was to have stumbled on this five-volume miracle of a translation, which is just worlds and galaxies and universes richer than that first version I’d read—and a whole lot longer, too. I’ve laughed and cried and puzzled and wondered my way through it many times since over the intervening 26 years. Reading it is an immersive experience on so many levels, and I am always amazed at how fully the author realizes his characters, some of whom are capable of making me admire them on one page, feel embarrassment for their foolishness on another, suffer with them through their losses, feel disgust at their insensitivity and even extreme cruelty, and yet still love them as human beings whose motivations I’ve come to understand intimately. Only a very few of the world’s greatest authors can render their characters in such glorious complexity, and for my money, Cao Xueqin is one of them. The author is as charismatic as they come. If you’re not yet a fan of Buddhist poetry, you soon will be. If you’re not yet into elaborate descriptions of Chinese aristocratic customs and manners now, your conversion is coming. If you think that tales of doomed teenage love are too sappy to bear, you’re going to drop that prejudice somewhere toward the end of Volume 4. And if you think it’s silly to cry buckets at the end of a novel, let Cao tell you why you’re wrong: When grief for fiction’s idle words More real than human life appears, Remember life itself’s a dream And do not mock the reader’s tears. See? The paperback copies I bought back in 1994 have been read many times and are still in decent shape. What’s not in decent shape is my eyesight, which is why my last couple of readings of “the stone” have been on Kindle. I hope to read it at least a few more times while I inhabit this incarnation.

This is a typical Chinese fable  involving hundreds of characters. It follows the growth and interactions of a large well to do family and it's branches. This in itself makes it difficult to keep track of each one but it is made even more difficult because each character is referred to by more than one name. Their given name, their relationship name ( Auntie Xue..) and their nickname. Aside from that the storyline is rather mundane and does not move along at a satisfying pace. But the biggest complaint is the translation, I have read other Chinese fables and have found them a satisfying read however this translator seems to have written his own tale. And it is done more as an English Victorian tale in words and phrases rather than a Chinese fable.And in his lengthy introductions he admits he has taken liberties with the earlier manuscripts and translations. His language is not at all reminiscent of other Chinese translations in use of words or idioms . While there are more volumes left to read I will not go beyond the first 3.

The story setting, complexity, entangled relationship among people, subtle feelings within characters are stunningly preserved. The main character Baoyu and Daiyu jumps out in front of you
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	D. F. Whipple	5.0	2008年8月28日 在美国审核	8	Enter 18th Century China Through a Looking Glass	This magical novel portrays a traditional society turned upside down: a boy who'd rather be a girl, women who are more powerful than men, and a faerie who delivers the most licentious of messages. Much of this panorama takes place within the tranquil gardens and hand-carved edifices of the Jia family mansions, where life is constantly in flux. Cao Xue-qin calls this The Land of Illusion, an ethereal contrast to the realm of the soul, where reality's as hard as rock but stones can talk; the author's interesting philosophy is presented with admirable wit and humility, too. Ontologically speaking, souls of all kinds travel between two realms that mirror each other on an elusive search for bliss. "Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true;/ Real becomes not-real where the unreal's real," the novelist writes, only to lament, "The disillusioned to their convents fly;/The still deluded miserably die." Life for the Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family is painful, chaotic, and scandalous. Yet sophisticated readers will marvel at Cao's expressive art and soaring lyricism--and David Hawkes's English translation is superb in its life and immediacy. The protagonist Bao-yu's object of desire, the fragile and elusive Dai-yu, is, quite literally, a Crimson Pearl Flower incarnate, and the volatile relationship between them is beautifully rendered. Born with a shimmering piece of jade in his mouth, Bao-yu shares her mystical origins, to be certain, but sensing their bond, he struggles all the more for it. What is the essence of her, he seems to ask, and what is the essense of me? When, in a moment of levity, some feminine beauties ask him "wherein lies your preciousness and wherein lies your hardness," the question wryly ambiguous, Bao-yu concludes with innocence: "No real Bo-tree the body is,/The mind no mirror bright./On what could dust alight?" A Western reader might quarrel with his answer, but in Cao Xueqin's masterful hands, reality is a lump of jade we can kick--a realm where moments of truth will fade to laughter and celebration.

1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	mp	5.0	2002年8月18日 在美国审核	272	A Remarkable Achievement	I spend a lot of time wandering through bookstores.  One particular book has caught my eye over the years, and the other day I bought it - Volume 1 of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth century epic, "The Story of the Stone:  The Golden Days".  As a developing eighteenth century scholar, I was doubly attracted to it.  "The Golden Days" absolutely blew me away - used as I am to eighteenth century novels (British, French, American), this is wholly unlike anything I've read from the era.  It bears structural similarities to the Laurence Sterne's "Tristram Shandy" and "Sentimental Journey," but aside from that bears more in common with ancient Greek novels like Longus's "Daphnis and Chloe" or Heliodorus's "Eithopian Romance," as well as the mysticism of the ancient Egyptian "Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor."  And yet, Cao's attention to actual life experiences, and the detail he conveys about tradition and ceremony, along with frank dealings with human relationships and sexuality makes "The Golden Days" much more than any quick summary of style or content can relate. "The Golden Days" begins in amusing, but sympathetic fashion:  the goddess Nü-wa is repairing the sky with 36,501 stones.  When she finishes, one remains, which is cast off.  Having been touched by a goddess, this stone has magical properties, able to move, change size, and even talk.  One day, a Buddhist monk and a Taoist come upon the stone, and promise to let the stone have an adventure - to become human.  As the stone waits by a pond, it falls desperately in love with a Crimson Pearl Flower, which is also selected for incarnation by the Fairy Disenchantment.  The stone and the flower are incarnated as the novel begins in earnest, as a young minor nobleman named Jia Bao-yu, and a commoner related to the family, a girl named Lin Dai-yu - both unaware of their heavenly origins.  "The Golden Days" centers around the daily events and occurrences in the lives of these two teenagers, as they come to grips, as we all must, with human life. The Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family, on opposite sides of Two Dukes Street, are the centerpieces of the novel's action.  Like the "big house" fiction of the English eighteenth century, these ancestral manses provide a locus of activity, as the nobles, their extended families, friends, and servants mingle and interact constantly.  Cao marks himself as a remarkable author by the way he handles a massive cast of characters, letting us into the private lives and concerns of all ranks of society, as well as the forms of etiquette that determine their relationships.  Another terrific facet of the novel's construction is the almost stream of consciousness style Cao employs - as characters pass in and out of the immediate action of the novel, the narrative seems to choose the person it's most interested in and follow them for pages at a time, before seamlessly passing to the next character.  It's really quite amazing, how, in this way, we come to understand the motivations, fears, and hopes of so many individuals.  Time, distance, culture, Cao levels distinctions, making historical China accessible to even 21st century readers - he reduces people to their human concerns. Cao Xueqin's novel is also remarkable for what I can only call it's pro(to)-feminist tone.  While we are reminded by certain characters that male lineage is of major importance to the structure of the society, the narrative consistently shows the power, ability, and influence of women.  At the novel's beginning, a Taoist named Vanitas finds the stone, and is asked to transcribe its story, but complains initially that it is about a "number of females".  The stone obviously insists that the story be written out.  Later, Bao-yu, the major male character, says he is more comfortable around women - that they are like water, while men are like mud, castoffs, unclean.  One of the main characters of this volume is Wang Xi-feng, a young woman in her early twenties, who for an extended period, manages the affairs of both the Ning and Rong mansions.  Cao's respect and admiration for the strong women in Bao-yu's life:  Xi-feng, Dai-yu, and two particular servants, Aroma and Caltrop, is quite obvious and important to the novel. If you are like me, and know tragically little about Chinese literature and culture, Cao takes care of that too - there is a heavy emphasis throughout the novel on the cultural productions of China.  The book integrates a wide range of poetry, drama, fiction, folk wisdom, and mythology as a central part of Bao-yu and Dai-yu's upbringing.  One can sense Cao's insistence in the novel that education and cultural production is of vital importance, particularly to children.  While the Fairy Disenchantment seems to be the guiding spirit of the novel, hinting at the diappointments inevitable in the course of life, this is a novel about youth, and hope for the future, even in the midst of concern about how long prosperity can last.  Taken altogether, "The Golden Days" cannot be recommended enough.  David Hawkes's translation is first rate, and his introduction, pronunciation notes, and appendices are thorough and very helpful.

The five-volume story chronicles the family's high-living glory days through their bitter decline, all the while immersing the reader in rich details of daily life in 18th century China.  I completely agree with the following quote from the Times Higher Educational Supplement: "an astonishing book.  It recreates a world that would otherwise be utterly lost."  Anyone even mildly interested in Chinese history and culture will be enthralled by this glimpse into the privileged world of wealthy 18th century Chinese. Author Cao Xueqin was truly a creative genius - Story of the Stone is multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, and superbly crafted. While reading the first chapter of the first book (Dream of the Red Chamber), I was struck with how utterly clever and imaginative the story is.  You will instantly be aware that you are reading something that has endured almost three hundred years for a very good reason.  The story is populated with dozens of wonderfully three-dimensional characters - many of whom are woven in and out of the story making for a most interesting read.  Most notable is the spoiled and curiously effeminate protagonist Jia Bao-yu, who possesses a special, magical item that I won't reveal here (don't want to spoil your enjoyment of the book!). All of the elements that make traditional Chinese literature such a joy to read are embodied in Story of the Stone.  Elaborate settings, delicate verse, and traditional symbolism (with a healthy dose of humor and bawdiness) create a beautiful and riveting story that will keep you wanting more.  I highly recommend reading the entire 5-book series.  It is impressive that a work can stand the test of time as well as Story of the Stone has. David Hawkes' fine translation is excellent.  Although some have criticized him for using too much "slang," I feel that his translation is effective in expressing the character's true sentiments, and it is tremendously easy to read.  Story of the Stone is an unforgettable and awesome read that I highly recommend.

David Hawkes has done an amazing job translating this brilliant 18th-century novel into colloquial modern English. I have read all the translations-- this is my favorite novel, and this is by far the best version for an English speaker who just wants a good book. I can imagine that a Chinese reader could pick holes in this translation, as I could nitpick at a translation of Shakespeare-- the wealth of the original is impossible to transfer whole into another language and culture. If you want a word-for-word translation so you can use this as a study guide while you read the Chinese, maybe the wooden Beijing Languages version could help you! But I have a hard time imagining any new translation being more vivid and fun to read than this one. Yes, it is littered with sometimes annoying Britishisms. That is the price of a colloquial translation! It's true that Hawkes does not explain all the references-- that would be another book in itself.  And I am sure he made mistakes-- I help a French translator occasionally and even though he is very well-versed in English, it is so easy for him to miss something that only a cultured native speaker could pick up. But this translation is ALIVE. Until that perfect translation comes along one day, Hawkes's is still better than all the others. Be grateful to him! (2003)
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	Matthew M. Yau	4.0	2005年10月23日 在美国审核	31	When the magic stone met the crimson pearl flower...	The Dream of the Red Chamber (The Story of the Stone) starts off as an immensely long inscription on a miraculous stone which was copied out by a visiting man and taken down into the world for publication. Volume 1 gives the account of the magic stone's origin, renders the discourse redolent of a supernatural, mystical overtone. Once upon a time a piece of stone that was unworthy to be used for repairing the sky possessed magic power and ended up in the mortal world. The unhappy stone incarnated and lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and returning to what Buddhist refers as the "other shore." Jai Baoyu is the incarnation of the stone. The name "bao-yu" means "treasured jewel" and was named after the wonderful incident that the only surviving son of the Jia household was born with a piece of spotless jade in his mouth. Lin Daiyu, Baoyu's teary cousin with a superior intelligence, is the incarnation of the Crimson Pearl Flower, which the unhappy stone once conceived a fancy that he took to watering everyday so the flower was able to shed the form of a plant and became a girl. The consciousness that she owed the stone ensued her to repay him with the tears shed during the whole of a mortal lifetime if they were ever to be reborn as humans in the world beneath. It was no wonder when Daiyu first saw her cousin, who had tyrannized the household, hated studies, and spent most of his time in women's quarters, it was as though she had seen him somewhere before, like a déjà vu. Aside from the ethereal origin, the first volume of The Dream of the Red Chamber depicts a fairly eventual record of a great Manchu household (Qing Dynasty) under the tutelage of the Imperial family in early 18th century China. It's the picture of daily routines in the life that emerge most vividly from its discourse. The Jia household is genuinely disguised as some highborn aristocrats whose ancestors were ennobled for their military powers. This first installment of five parts, titled Golden Days, captures the Jias at the hi-time in which members of the Rong-guo mansion and the Ning-guo mansion dressed in silk, ate delicately, pampered by a domestic hierarchy of servants and maids, when they were still nested in the protecting shadow of the ancestors and the readily accessible wealth. The family's decline and fall constitute the general background of the novel. With over 500 characters, thousands of one-hit appearances and a skein of household members and their distant relations of the clan, reading of The Dream of the Red Chamber will be more pleasurable and rewarding with the family genealogy handy. The book has a general flow of daily happenings and inter-family drama, with an emphasis on the relationship between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu. Household activities, domestic anecdotes, subbing rivalries, seditious schemes, love affairs, contention between concubines, political intrigues, black magic, witchcraft, and even murder constitute to the pages of this Chinese epic that evokes Remembrance of Things Past and One Hundred Years of Solitude. The heart of the novel is the pre-destined relationship between a semi-ethereal entity and magic stone under the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion. This meeting, though is meant to be, is in vain, one that is full of tears. When the fairy led Baoyu into the land of illusion and showed him his fate, he could scarcely make out of what he saw. Nature might have endowed him an eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. How does one expect a 13-year-old (scholars deem him to be 13 throughout most of the book) to recognize and seize his destiny? The fairy showed him not only his life cycle but also the romantic passions, love debts, heartbreaks of dust-stained human world. Baoyu was destined to mingle with girls around him. The ancestors thought Baoyu had inherited a perverse, intractable nature that rendered him eccentric and emotionally unstable. Exposure to the worldly illusions of decay might hopefully succeed in enlightening, awakening, and transforming him. Daiyu seems to know Baoyu more thoroughly than anyone does. She is able to nail his problem despite her occasional tiff with him over trivial matters. Baoyu always complained about people's getting angry with whatever he did, but he never realized how much he had provoked them at the first place. Couplets, poems, and verses in the novel hint at his friendlessness in the mortal world and the incessant debate over the depth of his relation with Daiyu. The roaming back and forth, sink and soar between sorrow and elation between the two incarnated cousins constitute to the understanding that earthly existence is indeed a transience but karma determines the shape of one's life and the life after. This idea of life being a dream from which one eventually awakes is a Buddhist tenet, but the incorporation of it into the novel becomes a poetic gesture to demonstrate that the main character (Baoyu) is indicative to the author. The Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese has the connotation of being rich and grand. The title can refer to a dream of the vanished splendor and opulence. The frequent use of dream imagery implies the possibility that the luxurious world of the author's youth, which he attempted to reconstruct, had vanished so utterly at the time of writing. The story of the Jias closely accorded with fortunes of Cao's own family, which attained its height under the reign of Kangxi. But the exact relationship existing between characters of the novel and members of Cao family is uncertain and discreet. Baoyu is assured to be author's self-portrait, whose struggle towards emotional maturity was delineated with an affluence of nuance. Other characters could be compsite of several family members over different generations for the purpose of disguising facts.

Walter	5.0	2010年8月23日 在美国审核	4	China in the Eighteenth Century	I'm surprised that I had never heard of this novel until recently. Covering five volumes and over 2,000 pages, it was written in the eighteenth century and depicts the life of the aristocracy in ancient China.  The first volume introduces us to many characters, and it's tough getting them all sorted out, mostly due to names that are quite foreign to Western readers.  However, the narrative is so natural and flows so easily, I found it quite easy to submerge myself in the story.  Perhaps the translation is to be credited, because although the tale is set over 250 years ago, I never felt as though the characters were anything but recognizably human.  I intend to read the remaining four volumes.  Quite absorbing and unique.

This novel thoughtfully and naturally weaves together several timeless human themes. If you enjoy literature which requires analysis at several different levels simultaneously, you'll love this book. Two notes for those who don't speak Chinese: 1)Learning the characters' names is difficult even for those with a background in Chinese, but the translator does do readers a favor by translating servants' names into English equivalents/approximations while leaving the names of the main family members in (romanized) Chinese. 2)Keep in mind that two of the most important families are named Jia and Zhen, which mean "false, phony, artificial" and "true, real, genuine" respectively. (This is just one of many iinteresting and meaningful messages inevitably lost in translation) Also, in my opinion, the first three volumes (written by Cao) are much better than the last two volumes (written by Gao E). Still, it's interesting to compare the ways Gao changes the story.

The only things I didn't like was the use of modern english slang in some areas, and the poetry translations. Otherwise, the set is a marvelous translation of a great classic. The Story of the Stone is a novel that should be included in any true curriculum of the "great books". There are sequences that are emotionally moving and powerful. This is the most complete translation in English I am aware of.

If you read it, and enjoy it, be prepared to read the other four volumes. The story is difficult to begin with, not for lack of interest, but because of the complexity of Chinese names for the western reader. The book is  provided with a useful list of characters for each volume, and after  referring to this during the first half of the first volume, all becomes  clearer for the remainder of the book. The story itself is a fascinating  picture of life in 18th century China, and portrays the development of a  young boy who has otherworldly origins. The western reader needs to view  dispassionately the Buddhist theme which pervades the novel, but when read  with an open mind, the philosophy underlying the novel is both charming and  practical (in its own way). I found the book addictive, though it has to  be said that others of my acquaintance found it too difficult to cope with,  and abandoned the story before the end of the first volume. If you  persevere, it forms a wonderful introduction to classical Chinese  literature, and those similarly addicted will find it leads into many other  books of Chinese prose and poetry.

This is not that kind of book. Rather, Story provides an engaging peek into the lives of an upper-class family in feudal China. The story takes a little patience at the beginning due to the large number of characters. But the reader will soon realise that how the characters are related to one another is not crucial to appreciating the book. Rather, each character has its own personality, strengths and weaknesses, and comes alive in its own right. I believe that the reader will, like me, come to feel for the characters in no time and look forward to finding out how their lives evolved in the later four volumes. David Hawkes' translation cannot be faulted. The writing flows easily and the flavour of the allegories and poetry are, to a large extent, retained.

The language Cao used is not the Mandarin that Chinese are using today, they were more subtle, superb, to the degree that author is capable to densify and enliven a whole paragraph in English into several sentences. (I will take some examples later...) 2. Cao was born from a noble family, he was well trained in Ancient Chinese Philology, Prosody, Rhetoric, thus the gamut of knowledge and references cause huge problems not only for Western Scholars (which are very few), but also Eastern Stone-Scholars. 3. The vissicitude of Cao's family is unimaginable to a modern reader, the richness of language, emotion and situation in which the author wrote this book render more subtlety than modern readers can fathom and writers alike to apply. 4. Too many puns, quibbles, word plays and moods of Chinese poetry are heavily distorted by both English and translator, and the names Cao gave to the characters always 'imply' something: Jia BaoYu (贾宝玉）implies 'precious jade', Lin DaiYu （林黛玉），黛 had several meanings, it can be used to describe a beauty, green color or the the material women used to draw eyebrows, of course it's an extremely feminine Chinese character for women. Xue BaoChai (薛宝钗）implies 'precious hairpin', Etc.... I am distraught by the fact that the translator never mentioned on this. * I will take one paragraph from Chapter 27 in Volume II, if you don't understand Chinese, you can compare the length of them. 紫鹃雪雁素日知道林黛玉的情性 ：无事闷坐 ，不是愁眉 ，便是泪眼 ，且好端端的不知为了什么 ，常常的便自泪自叹的 。先时还有人解劝 ，或怕他思父母 ，想家乡 ，受了委曲 ，只得用话宽慰解劝 。谁知后来一年一月的竟常常的如此 ，把这个样儿看惯 ，也都不理论了 。所以也没人理 ，由他去闷坐 ，只管睡觉去了 。那林黛玉倚着床栏杆 ，两手抱着膝 ，眼睛含着泪 ，好似木雕泥塑的一般 ，直坐到二更多天方才睡了 。一宿无话 。至次日乃是四月二十六日 ，原来这日未时交芒种节 。尚古风俗 ：凡交芒种节的这日 ，都要设摆各色礼物 ，祭饯花神 ，言芒种一过 ，便是夏日了 ，众花皆卸 ，花神退位 ，须要饯行 。然闺中更兴这件风俗 ，所以大观园中之人都早起来了 。那些女孩子们 ，或用花瓣柳枝编成轿马的 ，或用绫锦纱罗叠成旄尾执事的 ，都用彩线系了 。每一颗树上 ，每一枝花上 ，都系了这些物事 。满园里绣带飘飖 ，花枝招展 ，更兼这些人打扮得桃羞杏让 ，燕妒莺惭 ，一时也道不尽 。 Nightingale and Snowgoose had long since become habituated to Dai- yu's moody temperament; they were used to her unaccountable fits of depression, when she would sit, the picture of misery, in gloomy silence broken only by an occasional gusty sigh, and to her mysterious, perpetual weeping, that was occasioned by no observable cause. At first they had tried to reason with her, or, imagining that she must be grieving for her parents or that she was feeling homesick or had been upset by some unkindness, they would do their best to comfort her. But as the months lengthened into years and she still continued exactly the same as before, they gradually became accustomed and no longer sought reasons for her behaviour. That was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery, remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves with their own affairs. She sat, motionless as a statue, leaning against the back of the bed, her hands clasped about her knees, her eyes full of tears. It had already been dark for some hours when she finally lay down to sleep. Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence. Next day was the twenty- sixth of the fourth month, the day on which, this year, the festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall. To be precise, the festival's official commencement was on the twenty- sixth day of the fourth month at two o'clock in the afternoon. It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer; it is about this time that the blossom begins to fall; and tradition has it that the flower- spirits, their work now completed, go away on this day and do not return until the following year. The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party for the flowers. This charming custom of `speeding the fairies' is a special favourite with the fair sex, and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches and palanquins out of willow- twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find, which they fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs. Soon every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers. Moving about in the midst of it all, the girls in their brilliant summer dresses, beside which the most vivid hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy, added the final touch of brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour. * Thus for those who think this book is greatly written, you are right, but the original one is incomparably more gorgeous.
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	A. Koth	5.0	2012年11月12日 在美国审核	3	Harmony of innovation and tradition	I think the most important quality of this piece of literature that qualifies it among the all-time classics is the layering of progressive ideas within traditional Chinese philosophy and structure. The oppression censorship required Cao Xueqin to disguise all relatively innovative and rebellious themes under apparent themes of acceptance the current political and cultural status quo. The strict censorship also explains why the final editors toned down the material before publishing the novel and the last 2 volumes fail to remain faithful to the true gold of the first 3 volumes.  All good literature questions society and the individual, a skill in which Cao Xueqin proves to master. I highly recomend this book to any patient readers. If you struggle with deciphering the complex web of Chinese philosophy, I also recommend reading Andrew Plaks' "Archetype and Allegory in Dream of the Red Chamber".

With the tragic/romantic form of writing one feels a longing to understand how different life was in those times and places.  I also got a great feel for what the writers intent was and the criticisms of political changes through the translaters appendixi and annotations.  Great reading for thinkers!

Dunn	4.0	2009年6月17日 在英国审核	24	A charming book	I thought I'd sample some Oriental literature and decided to dive into this epic family saga. Having read this first volume and the second volume, I am very happy with my purchase. It is tough to familiarise yourself with all the different characters in the book, but very soon you realise that the abundance of people within this one family household is one of the delights of the story. There's always something going on, be it the concerns of the aged Grandmother Jia, the loveable oddities of Bao Yu, or the frettings of the vast array of maids. Don't expect anything dramatic to happen every twenty pages otherwise you'll be disappointed. This novel moves very slowly. But it is meant to be realistic and this again is part of the charm. Through reading its pages you learn a lot about Chinese culture of that time and this is exciting in its own way. I read the first volume and fell in love with the characters so much that I could not conceive of not carrying on with the remaining four volumes. I think that is a testament to how good the book is and, indeed, the translation.
1	红楼梦	The Story of the Stone, or The Dream of the Red Chamber, Vol. 1: The Golden Days	曹雪芹	David Hawkes	S. Prasad	5.0	2020年6月24日 在印度审核	2	A traditional “book review” will not do full justice	As I was pondering what to read next, I realized that this piece of work, which runs to nearly 2,200 pages (double the size of War and Peace), will be a perfect foil for the long evenings during the Covid-19 lockdown period. I started reading in earnest on May 1 and finished it on May 31. The 18th century saga, which is believed to be based on the author’s own life and intended as a memorial to the twelve Nanjing women that he knew in his youth, maps the rise and fall of two closely-related noble families. The characters, profligate by nature, waste away the immense ancestral wealth in frivolous activities, and often times find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Imperial authorities confiscate the family properties once their misdeeds come to light. After much tragedy, the family is eventually restored to its former position by the Emperor. And in-between all this fateful happenings, the great passions and follies plays out in full flow, which in a contrasting manner are set against the backdrop of the Karmic Law that lays emphasis on the intemperance of life on earth. Overall, the book is full of details relating to the social, cultural and spiritual life of the time. The Penguin translation was titled “The Story of the Stone” based on the novel’s frame story in which a sentient heavenly stone is sent to earth to live out the drama of human passion (one of the main characters, Jia Bao Yu, is born with a jade in his mouth thereby suggesting that he was the sentient stone sent to earth by two enigmatic Taoist and Buddhist priests). I still wish the Penguin had gone with the title “Dream of the Red Chamber” instead of “The Story of the Stone”. I think the title “Dream…” conveys a better sense of the underlying theme than the “Stone…”. The novel has some spectacular supernatural elements. Volume 1 has some good dose of the supernatural, but in sharp contrast, Volume 2 is completely devoid of it. Volume 3 has one or two sequences. It picks up pace in Volume 4 and reaches the zenith in Volume 5. The dreams, nightmares, premonitions, seances, and apparitions can spook anybody and borders on the horror genre. However, all the sequences are so beautifully blended into the narrative in such a way that they don’t feel out of place. Somehow, all those supernatural elements feel “real” like how one would feel the happenings in a dream as “real.” That is the big success of this novel. When the going is good, none of the characters pay heed to any of the superstitions, but as their fortunes begin to dwindle, you can observe that one by one slowly falling prey to many superstitious practices. This is a great insight into people’s psychology of clinging on to a sense of certainty and security as the world around them crumbles. None of the characters can either be classified as “good” or “bad” in binary terms. Each one has their good side as well as the bad side. Perhaps this is the great strength of the novel as it lays emphasis on the shades of grey when it comes to judging a person’s actions. Often times, you can justify a character’s actions from his or her point of view but cannot be justified from the other’s person’s perspective. One can spend a lifetime researching this novel. Don’t hesitate to enter the dream world created by the good old Cao Xueqin.

Book 1 & 2 is all about the good life.... lots of eating, partying and generally having a good time.  The translation is good and I think it's a great idea to leave main characters' names as it is pronounced in Chinese but the maids etc are translated into easy to remember English names.  Overall, enjoying the read and can't wait to go through the whole 5 volume to find out what happen.

Der Band ist mit "The Golden Days" untertitelt, und diesen Eindruck hat man beim Lesen auch: Der Überfluss und die Dekadenz, die Ritualfixierung des Alltagslebens und der ständige Ennui bei gleichzeitiger dauernder Unruhe dieser privilegierten Schicht wird sehr plastisch geschildert. Diese Kapitel des Romans wirken unbeschwert und leicht; vom späteren Niedergang ist noch nichts spürbar. Der Leser, der moderne Romane gewohnt ist, wird sich auf ein paar Eigenheiten der klassischen chinesischen Romane einstellen müssen. Auch wenn das vorliegende Werk das Erbe der mündlichen Weitergabe schon deutlich hinter sich lässt, sind immer noch typische Merkmale, wie die Einleitungsgedichte, die Kapitelschlussformulierung und die in Gedichtform eingestreuten Umgebungsbeschreibungen vorhanden. Auch der für chinesische Romane typische Überfluss an Personen kann etwas einschüchternd wirken, gerade zu Beginn; die ersten 5 Kapitel sind nicht leicht zu lesen, danach wird es deutlich besser verständlich, wenn die wichtigsten Figuren eingeführt sind. Man darf natürlich bei diesem Werk auch keine sprachliche Ausgefeiltheit wie bei Mann oder eine Charakterisierung wie bei Dostojewskij erwarten, dazu ist die Gattung bei diesem Roman noch nicht weit fortgeschritten genug. Trotzdem bietet sich dem Leser ein Familiendrama, das einen schnell in seinen Bann zieht. Der hier vorliegende Band 1 enthält die Kapitel 1 bis 26 (von 120), man muss sich also auch die anderen 4 Bände zulegen, um die Geschichte ganz zu lesen. Eine gelungene Einführung und äußerst hilfreiche Familienstammbäume runden das Werk ab. Die Übersetzung von David Hawkes ist sehr gelungen und hat neben einigen leseerleichternden Kunstkniffen (Namensübersetzung von Nebenpersonen) auch einen sehr angenehmen Fluss zu bieten, in dem weder die (homo-)sexuellen Anspielungen noch die teilweise deftige Sprache untergehen. Wem dieses Werk gefällt, kann sich auch "Die Gelehrten" (Rulin Waishi, "The Scholars") ansehen, da sowohl Thematik als auch Stil recht ähnlich sind.

While with the University of Chicago he decided to translate this masterpiece, preserving the verse and as well as the prose sections of this classic work.  One of the great pieces of Chinese literature (along with Dreams of Red Mansions, Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh, etc.).  The verse will be stiff at times (Chinese verse into English is always a challenge), while references will easily escape a Western audience, it is still enjoyable for the many adventures, philosophical leanings and even comedic elements that give this classic a timeless feel.  For all it's flaws there really is no better translation into English.

Moreover several of the stories revolve around sun wukong simply not bothering to inform his allies of the opponent's special items and abilities. The good: *settings and cultural differences between the human regions are well written. * The stories themselves are varied in plots. * Anthony Yu's notes are invaluable for readers who are not eastern culture buffs. The bad: * The demons vary very little exept for in appearance. One demon sounds and acts almost identically to the next. * Tripitaka is still very annoying. * When sun wukong finally comes across a worthy challenge a bodhisattva is almost instantly introduced to resolve the situation. * Characters become feeble or genius level tactician and super slueth to fit the needs of the original author.

This is the third volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, "The Journey to the West." The story continues to be fantastical, violent, and, despite its episodic nature, surprisingly compelling to me. I was reading the previous volume in parallel with Ken Liu's "The Wall of Storms." Once I started this third volume, I decided to shelve Ken Liu's book in favor of Tripitaka and Pilgrim's continuing adventures. For a Chinese classic published over four hundred years ago, the content is far less elevated and far more entertaining than I'd expected. Consider, for instance, this edifying quote, "Even a fart is additional air!" I am now impatiently waiting for Amazon to deliver the final volume.

I have reached, with sadness, the end of my journey through the four-volume, four-hundred-year-old Chinese classic, "The Journey to the West." I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu, then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story.   It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses. Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love. True, there are dragons and monsters and mythic battles, but of the two main characters, one is an ugly, ultra-violent, supernatural monkey, and the other is a timorous, puritanical monk. Moreover, the narration is less immersed in the characters' viewpoints than I usually prefer, partly because it frequently breaks into poetry. Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic. It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc. While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions, the characters and the situation change slowly, sometimes imperceptibly.   Any or all of the above might have deterred me. Had I been in a more cantankerous mood, perhaps they would have done so. Yet they did not. By and large, I liked the digressions into poetry. I accepted the cowardice of one character, the violence of the other, the less-than-immersive narration, the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels. I liked the lightness of tone, the sense of fun. Most of all, I grew fond of the characters, as I think the author was fond of them. I wanted to spend time in their company, and am left now, at the end of the long journey, missing them.

The Journey to the West was my birthday present to him — and he loved it. He read a couple of pages to me, and it put me to sleep. Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenth-century Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzang’s journey to acquire scriptures in India. Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation. Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker. Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story. Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven. According to my husband, who read every word of the four volumes including the footnotes, the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism.

Hey, this is the "Journey to the West". one of the best fantasy adventures of all times.  I wish I had read it as a child, or had it read to me. It was extremely fun and entertaining. This was the first time I had read the novel.  I had seen a few movies that lead up to or were a truncated version of the actual story.  Finally learning who the "Handsome Monkey King" was enlightening and aided my comprehension of a Taoist text I had read that discusses the "monkey mind" frequently.  While the acknowledged hero in the story is the Buddhist monk who is sent on the journey to the west to retrieve sutras from the Buddha, the real hero is Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King!?! He's the wildest hero I've ever read about.  It takes a while to get the actual journey by all 4 pilgrims but I enjoyed reading how the Sun Wukong became the Monkey King and created such a ruckus in Heaven! Anyone who ever created a comic book or animated superhero must have read or heard of this story and used a variety of Sun Wukong's powers to create their hero.  this will be yet another novel that I'll read at least once per year.

22	西游记	Monkey: A Journey to the West	吴承恩	David Kherdian	Amazon Customer	4.0	2014年4月25日 在美国审核	1	An Epic, With Humor & Drama	The Tang priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, along with their horse - a transformed river dragon - have to travel from the Tang court in China to the Western Heaven. Their mission: to retrieve the Scriptures from Buddha and deliver them to the Emperor. If they succeed, China will become a happy, prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued. But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils. In the end it takes 14 years; in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent, loyal team, win through dozens of unheard-of threats to life and limb, and achieve enlightenment. This is another long classic in the spirit of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" that goes on and on with twists and turns that take you by surprise, except for the fact - spoiler alert! - that you know that the four heroes must eventually win through, deliver the Scriptures, and achieve enlightenment. A lot of the Buddhist hierarchy shows up unbidden, or is called upon for help by Monkey as he solves problem after problem on the journey West, so it's an entertaining introduction to those folks. The tone is lighthearted; even the constant threats to the Tang priest's life, as monsters try to capture and eat him (thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh) have a funny side. A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey; he's incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions, even in Heaven; but his heart is usually in the right place. His capabilities are vast, including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic, but his hubris often leads him astray. This is pitched as a children's tale - although the occasional sex and almost constant fairy-tale violence might make it an older children's tale - and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony. It's a fun read, and I was disappointed when it was over. I'd recommend it!
22	西游记	Monkey: A Journey to the West	吴承恩	David Kherdian	Amazon Customer	5.0	2002年1月9日 在美国审核	72	Excellent translation, well-selected chapters	I currently own 3 different versions of "Journey to the West", and of the three, this one is probably the best compromise between detail and brevity. I am currently reading it to my 7-year-old (I read it by myself a while ago), and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch (I have to explain 4 or 5 words on most pages), he's really loving it. The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel, The Wizard of Oz, and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages. I previously read "Adventures of Monkey King" (ISBN 0962076511) to my son, and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child, the story was overly abridged, and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost. This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well, but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse, Pigsy, and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire.  As a result, Pigsy and Sandy are a bit under-developed, but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine, and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka, at least.  I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories, because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story ("Journey to the West (4-Volume Boxed Set)", ISBN 7119016636), and fill in the missing stories if you want to. The way it's told here, the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story.  It's all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda.  In the full-length version, the story is mostly about the journey, and how it changes the characters. This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and "find out what happens", but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best, and aren't anxious for it to end.  Be warned, though, the full version can drag a bit if you're hoping to actually see the plot move along. I have heard that the book "Monkey/Folk Novel of China" (ISBN 0802130860) best captures the comedic aspects of the story, so that will be my next purchase. The British (well, really, Chinese via Japan) TV series "Monkey" is also based on this story. I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia, and that a British release is coming that will include the 13 previously unaired Japanese episodes (with subtitles). As the series was never aired in America, I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it, so that's what I plan to do. The story is that good.

22	西游记	Monkey: A Journey to the West	吴承恩	David Kherdian	Gary  Mugg	5.0	2012年12月21日 在美国审核	1	Important for Understanding Chinese Mythology	The book is difficult for most Western readers, because some of the language is so fantastic in its description of all the different spirits, monsters, immortals, etc.  But just stick with it and by the end of the book you will have an increased understanding of the mythology that works its way into a lot of Chinese Cultural opionions. I initially started reading this, because it is one of what is touted as one of the essential Chinese classics, and also because my wife, who is Chinese, was born in the Monkey Year, and I was born in the Boar Year.  The 4 main characters of the novel are Monkey, Pig, Friar Sand and the brother of the Tang Emporer.  My former business partner is named Tang, so, for me the book was irresistable. But, as I said, the book is very long, and the variety of monsters, spirits, immortals, etc. is mind boggling, but somehow, at the end it makes a unified impression, and from reading all the different subplots, you gain an understanding of Chinese culture that simply cannot be gained without it. gjmugg

22	西游记	Monkey: A Journey to the West	吴承恩	David Kherdian	Amazon Customer	4.0	2011年5月30日 在美国审核	27	Irritaitng Yet Fascinating	This is a challenging book to review in that it is long, as are the other classic Chinese epics (Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh and Dream of the Red Chamber) and accordingly contains much that will on the one hand provoke, entertain and inspire the modern reader while also containing much many are likely to find infuriating. The basic plot is simple and well-known (and easily researchable on Wikipedia and other web sites). An emperor of China's Tang dynasty, seeking enlightenment for his kingdom, appoints a monk to journey to the west (India) to worship the Buddha and bring back the scripture. The monk has four disciples (fallen beings who are being given a chance to redeem themselves) who help him. These are the Monkey King, the Pig, and Friar Sand, and the horse. Pig and Friar Sand were heavenly Generals who messed up and were put into the bodies of animals. The horse is a dragon who is working off a sin by being in the body of a horse. Monkey was born of stone and is redeeming himself after having caused considerable chaos in and even revolted against heaven, taking on everybody there including the Jade Emperor (a stand-in, it seems, for God). This is based on a true story wherein a Tang emperor really did send a monk on a mission to bring back Buddhist scripture, and also gather information (a Lewis & Clark type exploratory mission). It's a long trip accomplished on foot and for the monk, horseback (the main modes of transportation back then). The disciples can travel via cloud, but not the monk. But in the epic, the length of the trip is the least of the challenges. Again and again and again the party is beset by demons many of whom want to eat the monk's flesh in order to gain eternal life (something that is said to be possible given the monk's purity). Unlike other famous fictional voyagers, though, this monk couldn't fight his way out from under a grain of rice. He spends pretty much the entire epic weeping and complaining. It's mainly Monkey, helped more or less (emphasis on "less") by the other disciples, that constantly has to overcome the obstacles. The points of interest, the good parts, come from the nature of the adventures (quite varied and imaginative) and perhaps more important, the key relationships: between Monkey and the Monk, between Monkey and the assortment of deities, and between Monkey and the other disciples. The monk is the prototypical whiney nerd. As mentioned, his specialties are weeping and complaining. Moreover, he is fooled by more illusions than a ten-year-old at a cheap magic show; actually, he's fooled by all illusions. Monkey, on the other hand, is the one who "gets it." His ability to see what's real isn't quite 100%, but its close and even when he errs, he corrects himself very quickly. He is, perhaps, the single greatest, most skilled, and most powerful (lots of magic powers) sidekick in all of literature (East or West). So you'd think the Monk would revere and trust Monkey, right? Not so. The Monk does not trust Monkey at all and rejects his advice every time, until he gets into a mess and has no choice to do what Monkey demands in order to escape the crisis, only to distrust Monkey again next time. Twice in the epic, Monk gets so angry at what he perceives to be a bad attitude on the part of Monkey, he fires him (kicks him out of the expedition), but, of course, is force to be reconciled lest he wind up as dinner for a monster. But the Monk just doesn't learn. He continually trusts Pig, whose main concern is his own indulgence. As to capabilities, Pig is OK, but a distant second behind Monkey. I'm not sure why the author fusses about the horse and Friar Sand. Neither has any discernable personality and both seem to be there just to carry stuff. And this is where we begin to get into things that may annoy a modern Western reader. The practice of the art of fiction here is not what we're used to. The epic relies a lot, and I mean A HECK Of A LOT on a fictional technique known as "deus ex machina" which translates literally to "God out of the machine." It's well known in ancient Greek theater. The author sets up a fascinating plot conflict and then finds himself unable to logically solve it, so an actor playing one the Gods is lowered to the scene from a set of pulleys (the machine) to sort everything out. The Greeks get away with it because the conflict is usually more important than the details of how it's resolved, but even they don't completely escape criticism. In this epic, "deus ex machina" is used constantly. Like the Greeks, conflict and escape are paramount, but with the Greeks, you get one "deus ex machina" instance per play. Here, it bombards you again and again and again time after time after time in the same epic to the point where it becomes tempting to skip ahead once the conflict is established because you pretty much know what's coming. In fact, the adventures get so formulaic after a while, you may wonder if this is really a single epic, or something that was cobbled together from a lot of separate adventure stories. I have no idea what the answer is, but in the work handed down to us, the end implies it is a unified epic and that the crises were orchestrated from heaven to enable the Monk to become worthy of receiving the scriptures. But again, I can't swear this wasn't grafted on at a later time. One of the things that leads me to wonder about this being a unified epic is the way the Monk fails to even start to come to grips with Monkey's merits until the very end. To a modern Western reader, that defies belief, and having read other ancient Chinese epics, I'm not in a hurry to attribute such shallow characterization to the epic's different time and place. Also, the underdeveloped characterizations of Friar Sand and the horse lead me to wonder if they were developed in other segments of the story that got lost, or if the author intended to flash them out but never got around to it. It's important to note that my speculations as to whether this is a unified work or something that was patched together is just that, personal speculation. I have absolutely no clue about the facts and haven't (at least not yet) even checked to see if there's any research pointing one way or another. What I'm suggesting to you, as a reader of this review, is to draw conclusions about the fact that I am so wrapped up in speculations like this. That tells you a lot about how the work is organized, and how reading it feels as you get beyond the 22-chapters of introductory material. Clearly, though, the most intriguing character, and the one that makes the whole thing worthwhile is Monkey. His evolution from literature's most potent a**-hole to its most potent protector is riveting and addictive. It's a fascinating object lesson to anyone who has occasion to deal with difficult but talented people. The end of the story implies the monk needed to suffer to earn the right to get the scriptures. We modern folks, though, don't need to go through that. We can, if we wish, try to recognize the merit around us without constantly bringing ourselves to the brink of destruction.

22	西游记	Monkey: A Journey to the West	吴承恩	David Kherdian	Pumpjack	4.0	2020年6月28日 在美国审核	0	A Cosmic Kung Fu Trickster	With the pandemic limiting bookstore browsing, I’m spending more time browsing my own bookshelves, pulling out books that I meant to read but forgot. I’m not sure exactly how Monkey: A Journey to the West, retold by David Kherdian, ended up amongst my other books, but I’m glad it did. Apparently, Monkey — a bit of Trickster, like Coyote from some Native American legends, only with a mean streak and a propensity for fighting and drinking and stealing and causing cosmic mayhem — is a folk story dating back to the sixteenth century. It’s an allegory of the struggle we must all face before a spiritual transformation is possible. Like most great spiritual journeys, Monkey is spurred by a desire to become immortal. Given that he was born from a magic stone “fructified by the seeds of Heaven and Earth, and by the essences of the sun and moon…” I think he might have been immortal to begin with, but that point is lost on Monkey. He sets out to learn all the secrets, which will lead to becoming immortal. Along the way he tangles with an incredible pantheon of gods, lesser and greater, and elders and spiritual leaders and demons and dragons. The list is so massive, and most of the cultural references were completely lost on me. I wish there was a cheat sheet of characters to provide context because the significance of the Moon Goddess and Jade Emperor and Dragon King of the Western Ocean was obscure. Still, the book was a joy to read and I really started to feel for Monkey, especially after he got a mountain dropped on him for 500 years. I only wish the religious texts of my youth, suffered in silent confusion on hard benches, had a fraction of the energy, passion and entertainment found in Monkey: “Furious, Natha cried, ‘Change!’ Whereupon he was transformed into a ferocious deity with three heads and six arms. His hands held six weapons: a monster-slashing sword, a monster-hacking scimitar, a monster-binding rope, a monster-quelling club, an embroidered ball, and a fire wheel. Brandishing these weapons, he charged Monkey.” “So you’ve a trick or two up your sleeve,” Monkey said. “Well, have a look at this!” Shouting “Change!” Monkey turned into a demon with three heads and six arms. His cudgel had become three cudgels, and grabbing each with two hands, he engaged Natha in an earth-shaking, mountain-trembling battle. They flew through the air like meteors and clashed like lightning, each parry and blow a thunderclap, with sparks flashing across the skies like shooting stars.” When I finished the book and was thinking through all the battles and shenanigans and cosmic forces, I thought, “This would make an epic Kung Fu movie, why hasn’t anyone thought of that?” They did. I checked. There are dozens of them. Looking forward to watching them all.

From the description, I thought this story would be heavily involved in Eastern Philosohpy, and use analogies to explain the Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucianist dogmas. Instead, the majority of the book describes the dozens of battles between monkey and various demons and spirits.  The specifics/tactics of these battles are described, including weapons (axes, swords, maces, monkey's cudgel, etc.), the magical transformations used (monkey growing to 10000 feet tall, or turning into a bird, etc.), and the status of the battle (300 rounds and no-one gaining an advantage, the opponents head being chopped off, etc.). Although there is some discussion of monkey's training in "The Way" (with some Taoist and Confucianist ideas), and some of the Buddhist theories (right action, non-violence), the story is more focused on the adventures and battles of monkey and his master, who is searching for Buddhist scrolls.

Kherdian's version is certainly readable and enjoyable, but Waley's is more thorough and includes more of the religious elements of the original. However, Kherdian's version may be better for younger readers than Waley's as, of the two abridgements, it is the easier to read.

All my friends in Beijing told me I should read it first of the 4, and they chose well. Akin to the Wizard of Oz in America, the story has many layers of meaning, and provides significant insight into Chinese culture and thought patterns, past and present. The story is easy to pick up and follow in episodes. I will confess that I skipped over some of the flowery (and lengthy) descriptive poetic sections, but this is a good read. This edition is marred by having no good navigation system, and by  occasionalrandom misspellings (due to the linguistic mindset of the Chinese translator/s).

This edition has the advantage of being greatly simplified, and therefore may be more suitable for young readers.  Fans of the Waley edition might also be interested in this edition as a source for a few slightly different stories selected from the much longer original.  However, this edition eliminates much of the texture of the original and is overall much, much shorter than Waley's.  Most readers would be far wiser to choose Waley's classic edition.  This is a poor substitute at best, except possibly for children.

But few know that this book is the basis of the incredibley popular anime Dragon Ball Z. Yes thats right, im not making this up this is 100% true. If you look up the story for dragon ball, the first in the series of dbz, you will find that it is incredibley similar to this book. Monkey represents Son Gokou, the pig represents oolong, the great king of the mountain is ox king. If you are a big time DBZ fan like me, read this book and find out the origin.

It not only is a tale of monsters, demons and devils, it also sends the message of peace and tolerance in the form of the Buddhist monk Sanzang (known better in the West as Tripitaka) set in a time of great upheaval, not only in China but throughout the world. It is a mix of established Chinese mythology and beliefs, combined with historical events and the creative genius of Wu Cheng'en. I have read this book many times by many different translators and it never fails to please. Do yourself a favour and buy this book.

This Kindle version ( Monkey - Journey to the West ) appears to be the entire unabridged version of the story.  I also have the printed unabridged version which consists of 4 volumes totaling 2317 pages ( Journey to the West ).  I compared the entire first chapter of this Kindle version with the aforementioned printed version, and it's the same word-for-word.  I point this out as there are a few abridged versions available. So, the story.  It dates back from the Ming Dynasty, somewhere around the 1500's and was, I believe, initially produced in installments.  For those of you familiar with the Japanese TV series "Monkey", you will recognize the characters in the book.  The first part of the book focuses on Monkey, his birth, his ascension to the King of the Monkeys, his going to, and subsequent dismissal from Heaven.  The next part of the book introduces the rest of the team (Triptaka, Sandy, Pigsy and the Horse.  Then the book goes into the adventures the team have as chronicled in the aforementioned TV series. The formatting of the Kindle version is very good and I have yet to find any of the infamous typos and poor format found in some Kindle books.  The formatting is not as good as the print version (the chapter sub-headings appear to be continuous with the text of the book) but then again, you can't really expect it to. So, all-in-all, I am delighted with this purchase, and I would recommend this version to fans of the TV series who want to learn more about Monkey and who enjoy a good read.

Ich wollte die Reise nach Westen schon lange lesen und habe es mit einer Adaption der WJF Jenner Übersetzung (Beijing, 1955) versucht. Die war so abschreckend umfangreich und detailiert (weit über 1000 Seiten!) und unverständlich geschrieben, dass ich es nach nichtmal 5 Seiten aufgegeben habe und mich jahrelang nicht mehr an die Geschichte herangetraut habe. Dann bin ich, quasi zufällig, auf die Adaptionen von Shambhala Classics gestoßen und wollte es doch noch mal mit der Reise nach Westen versuchen. Diese Fassung der Geschichte war flink weggelesen. Verständlich geschrieben, aber stark gekürzt. Ein bisschen zu stark für meinen Geschmack. Oft hatte ich das Gefühl, Sachverhalte oder Beschreibungen nur sehr skizzenahft übermittelt zu bekommen. Ebenso fehlt jegliche Poesie, die in der Vorlage ja eine große Rolle spielt. Aber naja, um einen Einblick in die Geschichte zu bekommen, reicht es. Man hat sie gelesen, man kann mitreden (als ob ein Gespräch jemals wirklich das Buch thematisieren würde...) Mir als unkonzentrierten Leser kam es ja auch i-wo entgegen. Inhaltlich kann ich nur sagen, dass Handsome Monkey King aka Great Sage, Equal of Heaven echt nen verdammtes A****loch ist. Ich meine, dass er nicht gerade ein moralisches Vorbild ist, war mir schon klar, aber wow. Selten so einen nicht-mögenswerten Protagonisten erlebt.

It does indeed appear to be the Unabridged edition of Journey to the West translated by W.J.F. Jenner, which is in copyright and published by Foreign Language Press in four volumes. This edition certainly has some errors of the kind consistent with OCR and suffers from poor formatting and a lack of a table of contents - which for a work of this size is badly needed. It also lacks any copyright information, failing even to credit the translator, and doesn't include the extensive introduction of the FLP edition. It is published by an unknown publisher called Monkey King. So, you can draw your own conclusions and for myself, I suggest instead that you buy the FLP edition here: Journey to the West

She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story, so we ordered this book. The translation is slightly awkward, especially the inconsistent translation of names (some are translated by meaning, such as "Piggy" and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name, such as "Xuan Zeng"). I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter. That being said, I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers, so I'm not sure if there are much better versions out there or not.

Kathryn Lin retells this story in a format accessible to young, and very young children.  Each of the 37 pages of this book is richly illustrated with numerous, bright, eye-catching watercolors and drawings.  Although this is not a bilingual book, for  parents wishing to expose their children to Chinese language or culture at an early age, the author intersperses common Chinese characters (along with pronunciation and a concise definition). The character of the Monkey King is reminiscent of Curious George. Or, one could say Curious George is reminiscent of the Monkey King.  I highly recommend this book to parents who want to familiarize  their children to another culture, especially those with children who already have an interest in Sagwa, Mulan, or other Chinese-themed children’s books.

This is the 2nd translation I have read. For the westerner all the Chinese names can get confusing. One approach is to imagine an Asian coming to America and all your friends names are Smith, Jones, and Williams. At least I know quite a few, and they are NOT related. This translation actually has an appendix in the 2nd volume that lists all the names. REALLY HELPFUL!   Personally, I started reading the 1st translation I have, (in four volumes "not for sale in the USA") as the tv series, Game of Thrones got into it's 2nd season. My friends, who I watch it with are fanatics about the series. makes sense it has been the #1 TV show, several years running. For me, the Three Kingdoms has been much more enjoyable. Sometimes history is just better than the the most creative fiction. Now, this is a romanticized version of a piece of early Chinese history almost 2000 years ago. Every so often, I have to remind myself that this stuff essentially did happen. There is one scene, (an event in actual history) regarding some actions by Cao Cao that is, well, still talked about today in China, and a very dark stain to Chinese history. (OK, so there are some serious stains in Scottish and western history..)   As a westerner, I have to keep reminding myself that so much of what I am reading did actually happen. Even when I step away and remind myself that the author himself, (or whom this writing is  accredited to), lived centuries later. Well, the authors time is STILL over 1,000 years ago! Step away from Games of Thrones, or better, since the series has to wait for the author to catch up, use that break and read this series. Don't worry if all the names and locations appear confusing. Just read it. I read half of it over two days non-stop. (fortunately it was the weekend) and I am NOT a bookworm. It is hard to get me to sit down and read something. Perhaps I am praising this work too much... However, I really feel that this story is one that every westerner in the 21st century should read. It will not explain China or even Asian culture today. As it is considered one of the "5 classics" in Asian culture. It is Camelot on steroids. It almost puts the American Civil War to sleep, and as a proud American, I wish the story of our founding fathers could be half as exciting. Have fun and good luck!  Don't try to read it on the bus! or during your lunch break. You might get fired for no showing up to work..

Take the opening sentences: "Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been." Compare this with Taylor's translation: "Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity." Or Hegel's: "Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce." It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator. [This review is a duplicate of the one I submitted for volume 1]

26	三国演义	Romance of the Three Kingdoms	罗贯中	C. H. Brewitt-Taylor	John C. Cravey	5.0	2018年4月18日 在美国审核	6	The Art of War in Practice	Translation: Brewitt-Taylor, 120 chapters, 596186 words (Suggestions for more enjoyable reading are at the bottom of his review.) I’ve yet to run across another book that has done a better job of integrating combat action, strategy, tactics and politics.  In spite of its length I never got tired of reading it.  It leaves an impression the further you read—as I progressed through the book I noticed that I began to think more strategically--like a chess player. This is a historical novel, not an authoritative history text.  The history text of this period was RECORDS OF THE THREE KINGDOMS and like many works of fiction based on history, many parts of the ROMANCE can only have been speculation.  Also, skeptics might be unimpressed by the accounts of the supernatural (visions, omens, prophetic dreams (some of them horrible nightmares), miracles, ghosts, etc.) But the ROMANCE stands on its own as a work of fiction.  And not only do the supernatural events add a dash of spice, they’re also important in illuminating what’s going on underneath the worldly events.  For example, the fantastic account of Daoist magician, Zuo Ci, is probably as close to a peyote vision as most of us will ever get.  But it also presents us the enigma of powerful men.  Cao Cao was a great military leader and political ruler, but Zuo Ci offers him a chance to become a god.  You would think that godhood would be irresistable, but Cao Cao can’t give up his earthly power and his yearning to defeat and dominate other mortals.  In spite of that, powerful men are also hungry for supernatural powers.  They need to see the future and science only takes them so far.  They also have to dabble in religious thinking because everyone down to the humblest peasant takes the mandate of heaven very seriously.  It’s so serious that it starts a civil war in China, possibly the hardest country in the ancient world in which to wage a civil war due to its massive geographic size. This is also the story of effective military leaders and advanced military technology in the ancient world.  There were great strategists and generals like Cao Cao, Jia Xu, Xu Huang, Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Lu Xun, Sima Yi, Deng Ai and especially Zhuge Liang.  I wish that more of the tactics that were mentioned had been fully described, but there were plenty of details.  For example, The Shu army suffered a major setback because of one bad gully.  Combats involved not only swordsmen but also messengers, logistics, engineers (tunnels, fortifications, moats, mounds, catapults), archers, incendiaries and riverine warfare.  Zhuge Liang even invented some kind of supply railroad, disguised as livestock.  Even tribesmen had metallic carriages.  This is one of the best novels I’ve ever read. 4.6 stars Suggestions for more enjoyable reading: 1. The first third of the book is essentially background. The story of how the Han dynasty became three separate kingdoms will be told here. The problem for you if you’re a Westerner (like me) is that it is chock full of Chinese names. In the course of the book you’ll become familiar with Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Cao Cao, Sun Quan, Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang. You might want to be aware of great generals and strategists like Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Jia Xu, Lu Xun and and Xu Huang. But there are hundreds more and they’re not always easy to remember. Therefore, make a “cheat sheet” with what I would consider to be the most important names along with a small bit of biographical information on each.  (Try to limit this information to their rank, skill and who they served--You want to avoid including spoiler data.)  Do this for the names I’ve already mention and add Chen Gong, Cheng Pu, Ding Yuan, Dong Zhuo, Fan Chou, Guo Si, He Jin, Huangfu Song, Jian Shuo, Li Jue, Li Su, Lu Bu, Lu Zhi, Ma Teng, Tao Qian, Wang Lang, Wang Yun, Xun Yu, Yuan Shao, Zhang Ji, Zhang Yang, Zhou Yu and Zhu Jun. You should be able to ignore the rest.  The good news is that, after the background is covered, there won’t be many more names to remember. 2. You’ll enjoy the book much more if you have a set of good maps.  If your edition of the book lacks maps, you can find decent maps on the internet.  I found two or three maps that were useful.  I found the most useful map by googling “Map of the Three Kingdoms” and then downloading the map with the white land mass with the word “WEI” in blue, “SHU” in red and “WU” in green.  The problem is that this map is huge.  What I did was to use my graphics software to cut this map into smaller pieces.  The best idea is to cut them centering on the borders of the kingdoms because that’s where the battles will be.  I printed the JPG as a PDF document.  Then I found an online utility that converted PDF to MOBI format and put the maps on my Kindle (or did I just put the PDF on the Kindle?  Try both to see which works).  It was a bit of a pain to keep leaving the book to look at the maps, but at least I had some sense of where these guys were fighting.

Foi uma compra meio impulsiva, mas o preço estava tão bom que decidi tentar. E não me arrependo de nada. O livro é um relato altamente ficcionalizado do período (em outras palavras, não leia como um livro de história muito seriamente), mas os personagens, o enredo não devem em nada para uma obra similar de hoje como Game of Thrones (e, honestamente, enquanto eu não consegui passar do primeiro capítulo de GoT, eu li até o final desse livro). O que mais me impressionou foram os personagens: você é capaz de ver personagens tão humanizados, é incrível um autor do século XIV entende muito melhor disso do que vários autores modernos. O que é divertido é ver planos se empilhando sobre planos e dá para criar momentos de imprevisibilidade. Também se adiciona o fato que o livro tem uma aplicação dos princípios de estratégia chinesa (por exemplo, generais que estudaram bastante A Arte da Guerra, mas não sabem improvisar, são considerados ruins). O livro é longo, mas os capítulos têm um tamanho muito bom para a leitura, lendo um capítulo por dia, tipo, antes de dormir, dá para ler o livro inteiro em menos de meio ano (se os ganchos permitirem, porque todo capítulo tem um gancho para o próximo). A tradução é uma versão antiga, de domínio público, mas que deve dar para o gasto, apesar de alguns problemas (além do mais, a presença de arcaísmos ajuda no clima do livro).

In Volumes 1 and 2, Zhuge Liang has masterminded, with clever maneuvers, victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities, thus vastly increasing Liu Bei’s military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces. Liu Bei dies in Vol. 3 leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan. Cao Cao, seeks to take advantage of Liu Bei’s death and inexperience of Liu Shan. Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shan’s kingdom from five directions. I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat. However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out. Finally after 3 days, Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liang’s hut to hear what plans he has in mind. Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks. He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes. In his fight against the Mans, after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again. This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans, each time capturing the leader and releasing him. After the seventh time, Zhuge Liang refuses to even see the leader of the Mans and has his assistant release him. At this, the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future. The Three Kingdoms story is truly one of the great classics of literature. This translation is easy reading. The footnotes were not only helpful, but at those special key locations in the writing, the footnotes at the bottom of the page made the flow of the story more meaningful.

Collectively, these can be a difficult read from the perspective of so many historical figures coming and going, particularly later on in the series.  I have pretty extensive knowledge of this era of history, so it was fine with me, but just a note for anyone who knows little about people of this time that your head might spin a bit with so many character introductions. In terms of the story itself, Vol 1 and 2 are wonderful, full of action and intruigue.  Vol 3... while historically what it was, I found arduous to read through.  This isn't the fault of the authors, nor the translation, it's just not very interesting in terms of what happened near the end of the period especially in comparison to they first two volumes.  The figures of the later part of this time just feel flat as compared to their predecessors. There are some editing errors, typos, etc. and some odd word choices considering the context (hubbub, seriously? And siesta, I laughed when I read this used.) So, I definitely recommend it with the caveats in mind.

27	三国演义	The Three Kingdoms, Volume 3: Welcome The Tiger: The Epic Chinese Tale of Loyalty and War in a Dynamic New Translation	罗贯中	Yu Sumei	Colin H	5.0	2017年8月29日 在英国审核	1	A fascinating insight into the nature of power	(NOTE: This is a review for all three volumes of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms) I had been aware of this epic of Chinese literature for many years, but first developed a serious interest in reading it after having watched the excellent Chinese drama adaptation made in 2010. That gave me the impetus to pick up the first volume and give it a go. Some words of caution first, from one who has now read all three volumes. This is a book that very much requires you to juggle hundreds of names in your head and keep track of who is who. Indeed, I would strongly recommend watching that aforementioned TV series prior to reading the books. This may sound the wrong way around, but having made my way through all 1,377 pages, it would have been considerably harder without some pre-knowledge of key characters to anchor my progress. Having some understanding, for example, that a Lu Su matters where a Lu Xun does not, certainly makes getting through the book a mite less daunting. Another warning for those considering embarking on the Three Kingdoms: if you are not interested in military strategy and take no pleasure in reading about the minutiae of war, you should probably turn away. A significant percentage of the book is spent on detailing battles: many, many battles, often in quick succession. While war itself is not the core of what the Three Kingdoms is about, it is nevertheless the medium through which many of the story's messages are related. This is a fictionalised account of a very real historic period in Chinese history. After the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 AD, the country fell into a state of civil war, as rival warlords fought one another for superiority - each claiming to be the rightful successor to Han. Gradually power consolidated around three separate kingdoms: Wei in the North, Wu in the South and Shu in the West. Each was led by its own charismatic leader - Cao Cao, Sun Quan and Liu Bei respectively. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms tells their story, how they rose to power, what they did with that power and how each, ultimately, fell. It is truly epic in its scale, and widely recognised in China as one of the greatest books ever written. For me, this book is about much more than just a historic narrative. Still less is it a book merely about military tactics - although they certainly feature prominently throughout. Rather, the Three Kingdoms represents an insightful, penetrating look at power - how it can be won, how it can be maintained and how it can be lost. Each of the three rulers demonstrates different virtues and flaws, and is aided by a wide variety of generals and advisers, each with their own agendas. The ruthlessness of Cao Cao is tempered by his intellectual brilliance and his ability to exercise power without ever openly admitting to it. The virtue of Liu Bei, meanwhile, is undone by his inability to win his own battles and by his undying loyalty to those who do not always serve him best. The astuteness of Sun Quan is highlighted by the way in which he employs people best suited to the role, implicitly acknowledging his own shortcomings. Each ruler has a coterie of advisers, and the relationship between power and those who would shape and direct that power is fascinating. Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi both stand out as impressive figures in their own right, often outshining the men they exist to serve. Their interplay, in particular, is a highlight of the book. And it would be remiss of me not to mention Liu Bei's two brothers-in-arms: Zhang Fei, the oft-drunk and irascible warrior and Guan Yu, the legendary fighter who keeps his honour to his very last breath. Another lesson the Three Kingdoms teaches is that for all the struggles and grand designs, winning or losing may very often lie in the lap of the gods. A rainstorm at the wrong moment or a change in the direction of the wind can make all the difference. Illnesses strike down otherwise undefeated veterans, just as ultimately the collapse of the three kingdoms ends up owing more to the dissipation and idleness of the rulers' successors than to any great military victory. Power is ephemeral, and it cannot ever be taken for granted. There are so many stories and sub-plots woven into the fabric of the Three Kingdoms that it would be both infeasible and futile to assess them all here. The best I can say of this book is that it is a joy to read and its many pages a wonderful place within which to lose yourself. It is long, and there will be times when you may wonder if the battles will ever end with one siding achieving anything close to a significant victory; but stick with it and you will be rewarded.

Then I went on to Amazon to look for another version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms from a reputable press (Tuttle Classics, 2002) that uses the C.H.

There are some areas in which the book could improve. -The multitude of characters and relationships makes it difficult to follow sometimes.  There is a family tree on one page, but the printing is unclear and small.  I had to find a family tree online to consult instead. -The glossary is too brief.  I wish that the notes were in more detail, as sometimes I feel I am missing out a lot of the symbolism and such while reading the book. -Lastly, I wish that the aesthetics of the book matched the beauty of the story more.  It's slightly unfortunate that they just put the title in the Impact font on the spine...

The Foreign Language Press has also translated the other 3 greats of Chinese literature: - Journey to the West - Outlaws of the Marsh - Romance of the Three Kingdoms I have read all of the previous 3 and been favorably impressed in the quality of the translations as well as the comprehensiveness of including the full novel. Other translations I have tried to read had more flowery but less accurate prose, or were abridged. It also helps that they are using modern Romanization guides vs. the old Wade-Giles, which is a must for anyone taking Chinese classes (as the Wade-Giles system has been out of use for decades). If you have never read one of these four classics, then don't look anywhere else and get this version of the books. If you have tried to read these before in a different setting but been unhappy, then give these a go.  This is as good as it gets and you owe is to yourself to re-read them in a correct translation. Yes, the pages can be thin at times but that's a minor annoyance compared to the quality of the translation/text.

2	红楼梦	A Dream of Red Mansions	曹雪芹	Yang Xianyi	miriam ben malka	5.0	2013年8月1日 在美国审核	27	The Chinese Shakespeare	I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the "Redists", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!

It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him.  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful.  I think the story takes place in the 17th century.  I don't think it can be read in a hurry.  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book. Allow a year or so to enjoy it.

2	红楼梦	A Dream of Red Mansions	曹雪芹	Yang Xianyi	Michael Fridman	5.0	2004年1月14日 在美国审核	58	The Chinese "Anna Karenina"	This book is like Anna Karenina in the following ways: Both are masterpieces of epic proportions. Both are considered contenders for being the greatest works of fiction in their respective languages. Both deal with large, upper class families and the lifestyle and intrigue involved. Both are works of realism and paint a complete picture of a society. A Dream of Red Mansions focuses on the love between Baoyu, an unusual child in his early teens who is temperamental and spends most of his time with the girls in the family mansion and Daiyu, a delicate, sensitive and yet witty and extremely clever girl. The two grow up as children and live in the same mansion but the family does not hurry to marry them off as they have other plans for Baoyu. This is the main thread that runs through the novel's amazing 120 chapters. The other sublots are very numerous - there are hundreds - but none of them are sustained for the whole book. The main part of the book is the set of characters. Again there are hundreds but a few main ones which become the most interesting in this drama. There's the conniving Xifeng, Baoyu's strict father, Baoyu's assertive "other love" Baochai and the like. Unlike Anna Karenina, this book is full of humour, jokes and poems (which was where I think the translation failed the most as Chinese poetry rendered into English seems to lose the plot!). It contains moments of great sadness but also wit and quirkiness. There's been controversy with the amazon reviews of this particular translation. I don't speak Chinese so can't judge it but reading the text, it seemed fine. I guess if I saw another or the original it would change my mind but this one isn't too bad. The novel deals with so many topics that you really get an overview of what life in 18th century upper class urban China was about. It is VERY long but it's amazing how in relating heaps and heaps of seemingly trivial incidents you grow to love many of the characters. It's like most novels are like meeting someone and hence only seeing what they want to show while this novel is like living with them. And trivialities aside, it's very moving. A must for all interested in Chinese society or who don't mind persevering through 1200 pages to read a one of the world's unusual and amazing dynasty chronicles and love stories.
2	红楼梦	A Dream of Red Mansions	曹雪芹	Yang Xianyi	Luke	1.0	2006年5月20日 在美国审核	62	Great book, uninspired translation	There are two complete, unabridged translation of the greatest Chinese classical novel of manners "Dream of the Red Chamber".  One is the Penguin classics version translated by Oxford doyen David Hawkes and his son-in-law John Minford, now available on paperbacks in 5 volumes under the alternate title "The Story of the Stone".  The other is this China Foreign Language Press version made in the late 1970s by Chinese translators Yang Xianyi and his wife Gladys. With all due respects to the Yangs, their translation just isn't on par with the Penguin's.  The original novel is a paragon of how the classical vernacular Chinese language should be written; Yangs' version is stodgy and half-hearted and captures none of the elegance and depth of the original.  Their English borders on paraphrase at times and they don't appear to bother about stylistic recreation, eg. some sentences don't sound native at all - "The arrival of the edict rejoiced the hearts of all officials".  Believe me, reading the original is much, much better. The Yangs' works could be serviceable (as in their decent Lu Hsun) but this version of "Dream of the Red Mansions" is embarassingly outclassed by a far superior and more idiomatic rendition: David Hawkes's version is simply unparalleled and a labor of love. Given a choice between the two translations, it's a no-brainer: the Penguin is the winner anytime.
2	红楼梦	A Dream of Red Mansions	曹雪芹	Yang Xianyi	Matthew M. Yau	5.0	2005年11月12日 在美国审核	5	Tragic love story meets tears, seeing thorugh red dust	The Debt of Tears refers to Lin Daiyu's plaintive, obdurate settlement of her debt with fate and her surrender to lonely circumstances of death. Events in this despondent installment afford layers in increasing intensity of poignancy that presage Lin Daiyu's death and Baoyu's erroneous marriage to Bao-chai at the insistence of the Jias. The volume begins with an ailing Lin Daiyu dreaming a bad dream that confronts her pent-up fear and fevered mind. Like a rope on a pulley Daiyu's hopes and fears spin up and down with sighs and tears. Her health takes a huge toll and deteriorates drastically. The critical nature of her condition both alarms and frightens the maids who for fear of Baoyu's lapsing into delirium decides to conceal from him. While Daiyu harbors an acute sense of insecurity being an outsider in the Jias mansion and broods about being at the mercy of the Jias, the family deliberately reconsiders the auspicious match between jade and the golden locket. Baochai is crowned with praise for having the aplomb of someone twice her age. Her virtuous disposition finds favor in the eyes of all the ladyships. As the Jias frantically prepare for the wedding without Daiyu's knowing, the delicate frowner happens to eavesdrop the news and plunges into utter mortification. The prophecy contained in her nightmare is to be duly fulfilled after all. Bitterness and grief overwhelm her to the point that she conceives the only way to escape is death. She is determined to undermine her health and seizes her fate. The marriage between Baoyu and Baochai is an unfortunate mistake. It is an unexpected outcome of an incidence that should have otherwise favored Daiyu and spared her death. The sudden disappearance of Baoyu's jade, ponders Daiyu, nullifies the bond of gold and jade. But little does Daiyu realize that the loss of the jade on which Baoyu's life hinges causes the Jias to panic. The family resorts to hurry the wedding between Baoyu and Baochai to turn Baoyu's luck and rally his spirits. This paradox of the lost jade expounds the mysterious vagaries of destiny, the joy and pathos of life. Over the top of the hurly-burly of the Jias family life, there hangs the consistent reminder of some transcendental existence. Somehow the cycle of life is totally out of our calculation and grip. The wheel of karma is what inevitably governs the cycle of life and the human soul is only playing out a predetermined role. Life doesn't end at death for death is merely dispersion. The bitter end of the tragic story of love between Baoyu and Daiyu throws the former into a delirium. What follows would be a significant theme Cao Xueqin intends for the novel, elements that take on a greater emphasis than ever after Daiyu's death: Baoyu's enlightenment and disenchantment, the seeing through of red lust, and finally the abjuring of the world.

Having read both this translation and the David Hawkes' five volume translation of this novel, I personally prefer this one. Although the David Hawkes translation is smoother and more literary for the English speaking reader, I find that the Yang translation better conveys the atmosphere of 17th and 18th century China and the complex relationships between the various members of the upper class Chia household and their omnipresent bevy of slaves and servants. I even greatly enjoyed, from a tongue-in-cheek perspective, the "sayings of Chairman Mao" inspired introduction to this translation. I'm now ready to embark on my fourth reading of this book in about as many years.

Even though some may say that the translation is less then brilliant I still enjoyed the story very much. I was quiet sad actually when the story ended. It made me feel like no other book had ever made me feel. I've always cheered on the good guys like in "Outlaws of the Marsh" or "The Three Kingdoms", but this time I really cared about these characters. Shakespeare's got nothing on this story. The charcters expressed the way they felt through poetry and music. I was in the room and I knew these people. It accomplishes everything every other story never could. I'm just afraid I'll never have that same feeling again.

It is centered in a young man, Baoyu, and all his "sisters". Don't expect a story in the traditional point of view, I mean like greeks said: an introduction, a development and an end. This does not follow this trend, well, one could say that it sort of has an introduction and an end as a matter of fact but this book must be read as is, just daily life in the Rong and Ning mansions. Do not expect either a very deep story or characters, it is kind of superficial in fact although there a lot of characters and their whereabouts and machinations are told. It gives an insight though into what might have been the life in that land and in that time, keep in mind though that this still a book. An overall enjoyable piece.

HONG	3.0	2005年2月25日 在美国审核	10	nice if you actually read chinese	i have not read a different translation of this book by a different translator. this is not a typical review but a comment about the method of translation, pinyin. and i, with difficulty, have not finished reading. here's why: if you are an english speaking person, or english educated you will have difficulty in pronouncing chinese names of places and people romanized by the pinyin method. the pinyin method is only immediately/"instinctively" useable for the chinese speaking/reading person tongued with foreknowledge. to a non-chinese speaking/reading person pinyin is pinyin-hell. because you *never* know how to say it in 4 or 5 different ways. even if you have heard how one pinyin name is correctly pronounced you are still guessing when you come across names spelt similarly. then, for the uninitiated, there is hope to be found in a set of "pinyin rules" (over 30 - oh joy!) where by one can amuse oneself with, repetitively, before embarking on reading pinyin books. these rules are quite "un-natural" or to put in kindly - foreign - to the english-speaking tongue. here are a few taken from the web: q  Consonant "ch" as in  cheek u  Vowels "oo" as in  too ue  Diphthong as "i" in  ship ui  Diphthong pronounced as  wee v  Consonant used only to pronounce foreign words  The Chinese have great difficulty pronouncing the V. w  Consonant as in  want x  Consonants "sh" as in  she y  Consonant as in  yet z  Consonant as in  zero zh  Consonant "j" as in  jump most pinyin-translations do not provide such a list of rules or coach readers in this matter, or explain how it is suppose to work. again from the web: Putonghua (mandrin) , the national dialect has four tones. The Cantonese dialect has the most, with nine. In the four tones of putonghua , the word "ma" The first tone (flat) "ma" in means "mother." The second tone (rising) "ma" can mean "numb" or "hemp." The third tone "ma" the voice dips and then rises, means "horse." The fourth tone "ma" starts high and falls abruptly, means "to scold." did that clarify the rules or compounded the difficulty? frustrations runs high and runs often. everytime a pinyin name comes up i cringe which is like every other sentence. for the casual reader, how close or by what degree it agree with the original language is hardly the key to successful reading or its enjoyment. if you seriously want to learn all the subtle tones i suggest you take up mandrin reading and writing - and then find the original version and enjoy that!

While I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy or integrity of the translation, Ames and Rosemont have explained and offered justifications for their translations quite thoroughly.  The result is an informative version of this classic text attributed to Confucius.  Heavily discussing the ethics of ritual propriety and the need to be a "junzi" or "exemplary person", Confucius believed in wisdom and the law of reciprocity (the "silver rule").  Clearly he was concerned with preserving a moral tradition extracted from the collective understanding of the past.  While parts of Ames and Rosemont's introduction are tedious and could be better written, overall they have made a valuable contribution to the understanding of Confucian thought.

I am very thankful that Ames wrote this book as it has allowed me a glimpse into my heritage.

Murphy	3.0	2013年7月14日 在美国审核	13	mixed feelings	If you are a University of Hawaii student studying Chinese or Philosophy, you will be reading this.  Be aware that while Ames has done a lot of great work in Chinese Philosophy, he is really doing 20th century postmodernism on a Chinese background.  After reading this one might think that Confucius belongs to the same school as Derrida, Foucault and Rorty.  That is as absurd as it gets. But academics do not make a name for themselves being correct (outside of the hard sciences that is).  If they were correct, they would simply answer questions in a way that satisfactory to readers and move on to the harder questions.  Instead, they rise to the top of their fields by being wrong in the cleverest way imaginable and that is what Ames has done.  So a generation of American students and scholars are being taught that Confucius would be right at home with some 1970's style sophistry.  It is actually kind of funny now that I think about it.  I guess when you start with the premise that "truth" is a social construct, you can believe anything.

A lot of books don't include any Chinese language aspects so I chose this one for that purpose.  Confucius is definitely open to interpretation so taking the time to study the principles is a must if you are interested in it.

3	论语	The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation	孔子弟子	Roger T.Ames, Henry Rosemont Jr.	Hans Geuns-Meyer	1.0	2012年6月16日 在美国审核	39	Awkward translation, sloppy philosophy	This book consists of an introduction, a translation, and an appendix. The introduction gives an historical and textual background, and outlines the philosophical approach of the authors. The appendix has some further remarks about a new version of the Analects found in a Han tomb in 1974, and more ruminations about Chinese language and philosophy. When I bought this book I was a bit skeptical about the subtitle "A Philosophical Translation" -- What kind of hybrid monster would that be? What would made a translation "philosophical"? Is this like saying: a "deep" translation or an "insightful" translation? And what does this choice of subtitle mean for other translations on the market? Are they now, by contrast, all "unphilosophical"? But... I decided to give the writers the benefit of the doubt, and see what they had to say. Unfortunately, after reading the philosophical introduction, I came away sorely disappointed and almost disgusted by the intellectual laziness and sloppiness of the writers. Instead of two people trying to think through the real issues that Confucius addresses, issues that are interesting *either* because they are completely out of date (merely of historical interest) *or* because they still may be relevant for people today, whatever their cultural background, I find two muddle-headed academicians spouting nonsense about the "basically substantive and essentialistic" nature of the English language (sometimes generalized to all Indo-European languages) versus the "more eventful", "relational" nature of the Chinese language. If you just squint your eyes a bit, and pretend to sort of vaguely understand what that might mean, and consider the evidence for this view, you find mostly smoke, pipe dreams, the half-digested remains of past metaphysical discussions. You find stupid, plain falsehoods, like the claim that all Indo-European languages have articles. You find a severely misleading account of Chinese grammar -- underlining the supposed ambiguity and vagueness of written Chinese. You find arguments like "The very expression 'thing' ... -- dongxi '' literally, 'east-west,' -- is a nonsubtantial relationship." -- Deep! The book could, I suppose, still be saved by the translation. Unfortunately, philosophy gets in the way and leads the writers to use some very awkward new terms, like "the authoritative person" for "ren". The writers are aware of the awkwardness and try to justify their selections of certain key terms -- which is good --, but mostly I found their arguments, again, unconvincing and disappointing. The arguments are often either circular or straw-man arguments. All in all, I didn't find special merit in this translation compared to earlier translations by others. The language often seems clumsy without need. Especially clumsy if you know enough classical Chinese to see that the original is pretty straightforward and seems very natural. As an example, here is the first paragraph of the first book: "The Master said: "Having studied, to then repeatedly apply what you have learned -- is this not a source of pleasure? To have friends come from distant quarters -- is this not a source of enjoyment? To go unacknowledged by others without harboring frustration - is this not the mark of an exemplary person?" "Having studied, to then repeatedly" - that's in my eyes just clunky and wooden. "a source of" - the original merely has: "is (this) not pleasant". Compare this with the old Legge translation (1861/1893): "The Master said, 'Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?'" The last line in Legge's translation is quaint -- after all, this translation is more than a 100 years old, but the first two lines sound more natural to me. (Ames and Rosemont claim that "junzi" doesn't have a gender basis, so would probably object to "a man of", but that seems nonsense to me: women are hardly even mentioned in the Analects, and from a purely linguistic standpoint I also doubt that their claim is true.)

I started with my own, reading the Bible in two different translations, first the Hebrew-Greek Word Study Bible by Spiros Zodhiates, and then the NIV. Next I turned to Islam and Al-Quaran. After that The Bhagavad Gita and the Analects of Confucius. Every reading is helping me go a bit deeper and wider into man's search for God and, through that, meaning in this life. More books and reviews to come.) I read this book on a beach vacation a few years ago. I enjoyed it very much. I'd not read much previously about Confucius or Confucianism, the ethical and philosophical system derived from the man's teachings; this volume filled that void. The book consists of a lengthy Introduction--70 pages. The Analects are then presented in 20 "books"; the Chinese text is presented alongside the English translation. Appendices take up the remainder. What I enjoyed most about this book was the Introduction. The authors go to great lengths to explain the times that Confucius (551-479 BC) lived in--the government, the politics, the family structure--and the language of classical Chinese. This is most important to understanding a people, their culture, and what (and why) they believe what they believe, and how they build their civilization. We in the West know that the Orient is different; the authors gave me a better understanding of why. For example, in classical Chinese there are no words as there are in English for--among others--"freedom," "liberty," "choice," "individual," "reason," "autonomy." The authors write: "None of these English words has a close analogue in classical Chinese...." (p. 54). Let that sink in. I mean: *really* sink in. "Freedom." "Liberty." "Choice." "Individual." "Reason." "Autonomy." If you don't have a word to describe something, then that something simply and "correctly" does not exist for you. Frightening and eye-opening all at once..... So for me the Introduction and the insight it provided into Chinese language and, thus, fundamentally, Chinese thinking was worth the price of the book. The Analects themselves are stories of Confucius' wanderings in the countryside and his sayings on what he thinks is best for proper government, from the emperor down to local rulers down to relations among family. That's about it. But it provides great insight into Chinese thinking. The text at times is rather dry and straightforward. Don't expect "Confucius say...." nonsense. It doesn't exist. Read this book for the great introduction it is to one of the world's great and largest philosophical (some would say religious) systems. And also for the keen insight it provides into the Chinese people and why things are the way they are. What's past is prologue. Sept. 27, 2014 note: The September/October 2014 issue of Foreign Affairs has a short review of the recently published book "An Anatomy of Chinese: Rhythm, Metaphor, Politics" by Perry Link. The first sentence of the review: "Link focuses on how Chinese syntax is to a great extent ordered by speech and sound and not by the kind of grammatical logic at work in many Western languages. He scrutinizes the ways in which certain Chinese words take on metaphoric meanings." The book has a price tag of $39.95, but if you're interested in the topic, it sounds like a necessary book.
3	论语	The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation	孔子弟子	Roger T.Ames, Henry Rosemont Jr.	isala	5.0	2004年8月17日 在美国审核	17	Sheds new light on Confucius	Confucius has been much maligned since he is perceived as wanting a static rigid society. This translation attempts to show that that is not really true. The translators and editors explain in the foreword that the Chinese language is dynamic, and therefore Confucius sayings does not reflect a static society, but rather a society in a constant flux. It does come out that Confucius will not tolerate revolution, but he does accept evolution. He is not preaching a static society, but rather that all development should build on the previous. While he stresses the importance of ritual, he also hammers in that ritual must be combined with warmth, caring, and even humour. A more gentle, less rigid, Confucius appears in this translation. Lastly, I think Confucianism relates to Daoism as Shaolin relates to t'ai ch'i (or Bruce Lee to Yang Cheng Fu): on is concerned with the external, and one with the internal. It is just a matter of which way you chose. Ones you have achieved mastery, there is no difference.

The graphics are well done (cover, and layout of the text within, including the chinese original phrases, for those reading Mandarin). There's a lot of footnotes in the back, stimulating further research, and backing up the interpretations contained within, as well as an appendix with more material, that is intended to add context to Confucius' outlook on societal relationships and behavioral beliefs. Next, I had to admit that each page has different scenarios of interaction among people, or philosophical reflections, such  that, for some, this book is a cure for insomnia, no doubt. The fact that Europeans and North Americans have not been taught to read the Chinese alphabet or the language, further beckons understanding. Also, the 65 page introduction to the Analects is surely relevant as the author justifies himself, of some choices in terminology as compared to other translations and the works of previous tranlators. A read here on Amazon didn't understand how an archeological find could bring higher understanding of these classics from Ancient China. Well, the answer resides in the manuscripts. Much like the Holy Bible was discovered in several languages (Greek, and also near-Hebraic languages, for example) the meaning of the texts and the final translation will depend a lot on on the ability of the underlying language to express human thought, and the scholar's ability to read it, understand it, interpret it, and translate it for English speakers, no doubt. For $10 and change, this is a not a bad work to own.

"Ren" usually translated as "humanity" here  becomes "authoritative conduct" which is closer to Confucius'  original meaning of the word, which was "noble conduct." Another  unique feature of the translation is that the key Chinese characters are  highlighted as they appear, directly in the English translation. This is  probably not the first choice for someone unfamiliar with the Analects  because it is somewhat technical, but it's a must if you are looking for a  deeper understanding of the classic.

Ames and Rosemont bury the stodgy old Confucius and introduce us to a vibrant thinker--the kind of intellectual magnet that  attracted hundreds of followers in his own time and millions throughout  history.  Although their choice of translation for key Confucian  terms may seem unorthodox, consider where our 'orthodox' translations have  come from. They have come from translators with a knowledge of the  Classical Chinese language but all of the built in presuppositions of  Western (Christian and essentialistic) thinking (including, surprisingly,  D.C. Lau).  Since the standard translations (Legge, Waley, Lau), there have  been great strides in understanding the philosophy of Confucius' time.  Ames and Rosemont are not only experts in the language but are at the  cutting edge of ancient Chinese philosophy.  This book questions many basic  presumptions about Confucius' philosophy and deserves thoughtful  consideration.

But he has made a small error in his review of this book, which is important to note. This book is NOT by Hall and Ames, and thus does not show the proclivity towards 'pragmatization' that runs throughout their stimulating work. Rather, it is by Ames and ROSEMONT, a philosopher who has published extensively on topics in Chinese philosophy. You will find little by way of "speculative acrobatics and obsolete wheedlings" here. The unconventional nature of the translation may seem awkward at first but repays careful reading; Ames and Rosemont provide good arguments in the introduction for adopting them. (Also, the translation by Slingerland he mentions, published by Hackett, is indeed a fine translation with much running commentary.)

The introduction part of this book is very compact; it is full of insights about the development and formation of Eastern philosophy, and also about how Eastern and Western philosophies tend to focus on different values. What the authors had continuously stressed throughout the introduction - that they translated this book by considering the uniqueness, or difference that Chinese language and culture have - is indeed permeated through the whole book, making it more faithful to the original than ever. The book was, notwithstanding that the 'analects' is such a classic, engaging and interesting. As an Asian myself, I could explore further into my personal interest in Eastern-Western comparitive philosophy, together with refreshing yet faithful translation of 'Lun yu'

3	论语	The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation	孔子弟子	Roger T.Ames, Henry Rosemont Jr.	JS	1.0	2013年9月1日 在美国审核	11	Not philosophical, just bad	The "philosophy" of Confucius is nothing like today's analytic philosophy. Confucius, using the common language of those around him, spoke about the maintenance of rites and the importance of tradition. He did not write anything himself, because he was busy trying to push his disciples to get up and follow his example. He provides the deepest insight to his readers when he is most cryptic. Attempting to translate this into modern English at all is a difficult task, as the authors acknowledge. They claim that they want to aim for painstaking accuracy, explaining what they know about ancient Chinese society. And then they go off the deep end. Confucius speaks of carrying out the will of Heaven. The authors, claiming that "Heaven" is a Judeo-Christian concept, leave this untranslated as "tian", as if we were dealing with something as complex as Heidegger's Dasein. Confucius was never trying to be complex or inscrutable -- he was trying to smack down the "glib-tongued" sophists of his day and encourage virtuous behavior. Except these translators don't believe that ancient China had a concept of virtue, instead translating the single word "ren" as the impressive-sounding "authoritative conduct". Every mealy-mouthed replacement of a simple commandment with an obscure "philosophical" hypothesis distances the reader from the text and accomplishes the opposite of what the authors of the Analects were aiming for. This exact sort of behavior was ridiculed by Confucius in verse 6.13, but you wouldn't know it from the translation. Their version: "Confucius said to Zi Xia: You want to become the kind of counselor who is an exemplary person, not the kind that is a petty person." Very philosophical. My version: "Confucius said to Zi Xia: Kid, being a Confucian means being a gentleman, not being a scholar." This translation, to put it unpleasantly, attempts to shove Western philosophy into Confucius' mouth. UPDATE: I am eager to announce I have finally found a translation of the Analects that meets my needs. My lengthy review can be found on its page:

I wish I had shelled out a few extra dollars and bought this excellent translation in hard copy! This bilingual edition includes the original Chinese text (traditional characters) but the visual appearance of the characters is ruined in the kindle edition by extremely offputting graininess and pixelation. Unless the Chinese text is of no interest to you at all, you should buy the paper version. So disappointing. The more simple characters, such as 心、仁 and so on, are readable albeit ugly, but more intricate characters such as 德 just look like squarish blobs. Worse, increasing the text size makes no difference to the Chinese characters, which are apparently some kind of low resolution graphic inset, and so you can't blow them up to the point where you can make them out. Moreover, the fixed size of each piece of Chinese text varies from passage to passage, so some short passages have huge but grainy characters, while others have small and eyestrain-inducing ones. And that's not all - thee are a few typos in the translation itself, especially in the phonetic romanisation of Chinese terms. Don't rely on the text of this kindle edition if you are citing it in an essay! Do your eyes a favour and buy the real book.

4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Paul Haspel	5.0	2016年1月4日 在美国审核	66	Analytical insight into human affairs, from China's most famous philosopher	Analects, in case you were wondering, are "selected passages from the writings of an author.” I mention this definition here because it seems that the only time we use the term “analects” is when we consider the writings of Confucius. Was there once a larger corpus of writings from Confucius, and is what we have today distilled from some larger body of work? If so, then I wish we had that entire larger body of philosophical work, the same way we have a good many books from classical Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle; but that being said, I certainly am glad that we have the Analects as a distillation of Confucius’ philosophy. His Chinese name was K’ung Fu-tzu, 孔夫子, and the Latinate name that he bears today was probably bestowed by Jesuit missionaries to China in the 16th century. By any name, however, Confucius is a great philosopher who speaks to us today just as clearly as he spoke to the people of Chinese antiquity. He lived a long time ago – when he died in 479 B.C., the Spartan defense of Thermopylae had taken place just one year before – but it is astonishing how current and relevant his words and ideas remain. “Analects” is, of course, a Latin- and Greek-derived term; in Chinese, the book is 論語,the "Lun Yü." It is divided into 20 books, and contains a total of 512 Confucian sayings, most of them quite short. On this re-reading of "The Analects," I encountered some sayings that were already familiar to me: e.g., “To say you know when you know, and to say you do not when you do not, that is knowledge” (II.17, p. 65). Yet on this reading, I learned many things that I found new. Perhaps because I’ve been reading a good deal of classical Greek philosophy lately, I found some striking parallels between Confucius and the Greeks who wrote sometime after him. For instance, when “The Master said, ‘Barbarian tribes with their rulers are inferior to Chinese states without them’” (III.5, p. 67), it made me think of how the ancient Greeks considered any non-Greek-speaking society to be βάρβαροι, barbaroi, barbarians. I found myself thinking of the doomed tragic heroes of ancient Greek drama, men and women brought down by their tragic flaws, when I heard Confucius reflect that “In his errors a man is true to type. Observe the errors and you will know the man” (IV.7, p. 73). Confucius knows that his disciples aspire to government service in the bureaucracy of the Empire – hence the prevalence of sayings in which Columbus offers advice such as, “Do not worry because you have no official position. Worry about your qualifications. Do not worry because no one appreciates your abilities. Seek to be worthy of appreciation” (IV.14, p. 74), Additionally, in an acutely status-conscious society, Confucius’ listeners are very interested in what will help them achieve the distinction of “gentleman.” With considerable focus on the value of benevolence, Confucius suggests that “The gentleman understands what is moral. The small man understands what is profitable” (IV.16, p. 74). And in one of my favorite passages from the Analects, Confucius remarks that “the gentleman hates to dwell downstream for it is there that all that is sordid in the Empire finds its way” (XIX.20, p. 155). Readers who are interested in the Judeo-Christian philosophical and moral tradition may be struck by the ways in which Confucius disagrees with one of the primary moral imperatives of Christianity. In contrast with Lao Tzu, who in the "Tao Te Ching" tells his disciples to “do good to him who has done you an injury”, Confucius says, “What, then, do you repay a good turn with? You repay an injury with straightness, but you repay a good turn with a good turn” (XIV.34, p. 129). In other words, the only thing you owe to someone who has wronged you is straightness, directness, honesty. For Western readers, many of whom have been raised in the tradition of “whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also” (Matthew 5:39), this may be the most challenging passage in the entire "Analects." At the same time, Confucianism invokes the Golden Rule in a way similar to all the other great moral, philosophical, and religious systems of the world. In response to a disciple’s asking, “Is there a single word which can be a guide to conduct throughout one’s life?”, Confucius replies, “Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire” (XV.24, p. 135). Perhaps because it is the dawn of a presidential election year here in the United States of America, I found that I was particularly interested in one particular example of Confucius’ advice to his disciples: “Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is disliked by the multitude. Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is liked by the multitude” (XV.28, p. 136). Good advice in the state of Lu during the Zhou dynasty, and good advice in any modern nation nowadays. I had this edition of "The Analects" with me when my wife and I were traveling in Beijing, home of the second largest Confucian temple in the world. Walking in the Forbidden City, my copy of "The Analects" in my jacket pocket, I wondered how many readers, imperial or otherwise, referred to their own copy of this book while traveling between and among the buildings of this most impressive city-within-a-city. This edition of "The Analects" includes a glossary of names and places mentioned in the book, an appendix on events in the life of Confucius, a textual history of the book, and a chronology of Confucius’ life. Particularly helpful is another appendix, one that describes the characters of the different disciples with whom Confucius speaks in the Analects. For readers of Confucius’ time, and indeed for followers of Confucianism nowadays, the differences in character among disciples like Tzu-kung, Tzu-lu, and Yen Yüan would be as self-evident as the differences in personality that Christians see among Saint Peter, Saint John, and Saint Thomas in the New Testament. This Penguin Books edition of Confucius’ "Analects" is a very fine way to acquaint, or reacquaint, oneself with one of the most important books ever written.

This was my first reading of 'The Analects' and while it was not quite what I expected, as it does not contain a truly coherent philosophy or even a consistent mode of presentation or authorship, it was nevertheless an incredibly rewarding study. And I say study rather than read because while it is quite brief (82 pages) there are a wealth of "chapters" that will leave you pondering--in a good way! If you are worried about the stereotype of vaguess and aloofness in Chinese sages, you needn't fear 'The Analects'. The main thing that can obscure some of the "chapters" is their reliance on Chinese history and most of these are briefly cleared up in Dawon's notes. 'The Analects' can be picked up and put down at a whim due to the informal structure and you will never feel that you lost the flow of it should a few days pass between readings. While I can't compare it to another translation or the Chinese, I found Dawson's translation to be very smooth and highly consistent throughout, and he supplements the introduction with helpful notes on his translation of key terms. This is an edition primarily for the newcomer rather than the scholar (not to say it is in anyway "dumbed down") as it is wonderfully concise in its introduction and notes, never saying more than needs to be said. However, in my case, I certainly wouldn't have minded more scholarship and context. Dawson uses Pinyin rather than Wade-Giles, which is a welcome shift in my eyes, as Wade-Giles often feels overwrought even if it sometimes comes closer to the true pronunciation, and there is a nifty conversion chart included in this edition. This edition like all of the newer Oxford World's Classics is neatly designed with a beautiful cover and good quality paper.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	ZyPhReX	5.0	2016年12月18日 在美国审核	9	A Masterly & Incisive View Into Confucius' Work	Confucius - The Analects is a rather intriguing book since it aims to tackle information regarding the well known Confucius in a cogent manner. The book is laid out in a fairly straight forward approach with no frills that's an extremely quick read. Within the introductory section, there is some background material featured, while a tad later on the book features notes on particular translations that the book offers.  Knowing how complex translations can be, it's a well-thought out approach to delineate what the book means by each translated term, instead of assuming that the reader will know.  Not only that, but also, certain words have various meanings, so to be able to narrow down with precision what was stated is greatly appreciated. For individuals seeking veritable gems of Confucius, this book has dozens of them. Reading this book will certainly help the individual realize how the culture was at the time, and why the information presented here was so vital to the upbringing and society in ancient China. The totality of the book is seamlessly interwoven to give you everything you need for comprehension, while not an iota more.  This certainly helps since other books can be longwinded at times. Taking all into account the book definitely belongs in the libraries of individuals who value such knowledge with resounding depth.  Confucius was definitely a master of his craft, and this book exemplifies that quite trenchantly.

I think this one is closer to the original text, thus more paradoxical and sometimes baffling. Penguin’s is easier to read, but unfortunately that means that some paradoxes are “pre-solved”, an interpretation is already in place and part of the magic and wisdom lost. I think the best option is to read both, the similarities and differences are enlightening. If you have to pick one, my personal choice is OUP.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Aran Joseph Canes	4.0	2018年2月6日 在美国审核	2	A Difficult Text for Those from the West	The Analects are widely recognized as one of the foundations of Chinese civilization.  Understanding them from a Western perspective is, however, difficult. There is simply no genre that the Analects fits into within the Western canon.  Add to this a wide panoply of characters who the neophyte will find it difficult to keep track of and the reader may be left with only remembering some of the more familiar adages of Confucius. This is not meant as a criticism of the text.  It is just that a casual perusal of the Analects is not possible in the same way that one could read, for example, Greek mythology. There are no gods and only oblique references to anything supernatural. Perhaps the practical nature of the text is one reason it has endured for over two thousand years. I am not trying to discourage anyone from reading the Analects—I just think that a more complete scholarly guide than is present in the Oxford Classics edition may be necessary to truly appreciate the work. Casual readers will probably be most struck by the difference between the Analects and ancient Western legends and retain some of the sayings that have parallels in Western ethics.  Anything more demands much more engagement with the material.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	J. Marlin	5.0	2014年11月8日 在美国审核	9	Fine edition for a first reading of a difficult book	The Analects touches on the most important and deepest problems of life: self-mastery, social relations, government, family, and much more. Confucius urges us to follow "the way," to study, and to observe "the rites" as a worthy way of life.  He doesn't promise that one who follows this way will be wealthy or happy or enlightened or "saved," but rather that such a life is still the best one can live as it is decorous and ennobling.  I hear in the Analects a precursor to Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, which advocates a life pursuing virtue, with its attendant Golden Mean. Yet this is a very difficult book to follow because it presents no clear narrative and no obvious structure in our normal Western mode of Aristotelian definition, division, and classification.  Rather, it is almost a stream-of-consciousness collection of gnomic utterances from a variety of characters (mostly Confucius) presented with little in the way of context or chronology.  It works more by recursive themes, juxtaposition, and unexpected free association. So it's kind of like the way we experience the reception of insight in real life, which is one of the things that makes this a masterwork worthy of repeated study.  Indeed, I think this book is only profitable if reread and reread (I would say the same of Lao Tzu and the Bible). I find this Penguin edition to be a great choice for the first reading experience: D.C. Lau's introduction and notes give the first-time reader enough context and background to read this work with some understanding and admiration, but not so much as to impose an interpretation.  Please note that I do not read Chinese so I cannot judge the quality of the translation. I look forward to revisiting this little book again and again.

4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Karl Janssen	3.0	2017年11月20日 在美国审核	7	Prior historical knowledge required	The Analects is a collection of aphorisms, anecdotes, and other snippets of instruction compiled by followers of Confucius around 2,000 years ago. There are no doubt many different versions and editions of The Analects in English translation. The one I am reviewing is the ebook edition from Open Road Media, which is likely based on the public domain file of the James Legge translation from Project Gutenberg. There is no denying the importance of Confucius in Chinese history and Eastern philosophy, but how does The Analects hold up as a reading experience for the 21st century reader? To a Westerner, like myself, even if you habitually read philosophy, it is difficult to just pick up a copy of The Analects and extract the wisdom contained within it. In form and structure, the Western text that most closely resembles The Analects would likely be the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. The Analects is divided into 20 books, which are then divided into numerous chapters, most of which are only a sentence or a paragraph long. Some chapters consist of a few brief numbered passages. Like the Meditations, there is no discernible order to these chapters; for the most part they just fall where they may. While each individual chapter can be studied for its own merits, you’d really have to develop an intimate knowledge of the book as a whole in order to understand all the connections between the various chapters and form a complete picture of Confucian thought. Though the teachings of Confucius form the basis for the Chinese religion of Confucianism, the philosophy of Confucius is really a secular philosophy that concentrates on ethics and politics rather than any metaphysical worldview. Confucius’s teachings were intended as training for scholars wishing to enter public service and work their way up the bureaucratic ladder of government. He also, however, looks into broader issues of ethics, interpersonal relations, right living, and personal happiness that may be relevant to anyone’s daily life. Some of the advice on governing may be applicable to the political and business worlds of today, but Confucius’s emphasis on knowing one’s place in the social strata is unlikely to be embraced by ambitious Western individualists. There are some similarities between The Analects and the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius in their advocation of resigning one’s self to the reality of one’s place in life. While the Stoic attitude might be simplistically summed up as, “You may be born a slave, but no one can enslave your mind,” the Confucian view in a nutshell might be something more like, “If you’re born a servant, be the best servant you can be.” Just as the first book of the Meditations refers to a number of ancient Roman personages that the average modern reader is unlikely to be familiar with, The Analects is peppered with references to historical figures of China’s ancient past. Such references are pervasive throughout The Analects, to the point where you’d really need a master’s degree in Chinese history to figure out much of what’s being alluded to. There are plenty of passages that clearly state a code of conduct for right living, or list the admirable qualities of a superior man, but these are interspersed between anecdotes of dukes, government functionaries, and students of the Master, some of which seem to require prior knowledge of the characters mentioned. What’s a Westerner to make of such passages without detailed explanatory annotations? There is relevant wisdom in The Analects if you’re willing to dig for it, but rather than reading the original text most readers would probably be better off consulting a textbook that explains the teachings of Confucius in an orderly and accessible manner.

4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Joseph J. Truncale	4.0	2011年7月7日 在美国审核	10	A very good overview of Confucius thoughts and philosophy.	One of the most famous philosophers in history is Confucius.  This text covers various quotes and conversations with Confucius and his 36 disciples.  Since many of the sayings are spoken in mystical parables and some of the thoughts might  be lost in translation, it is not always clear what the message may be in many of these conversations.  Nevertheless, this is an important text for anyone who is interested in the many wise sayings of Confucius.  This book is broken down into what it calls ten volumes. Volume one covers fundamental principles and government.  The second volume discusses manners, morals and virtue.  The third volume deals with certain disciples and other subjects.  The master himself is covered in volume four.  The sage in his daily life is discussed in volume five.  The disciples, virtue, nobility and politics is explained in volume six. The government and certain rulers are covered in volume seven.  Volume eight explains the maintenance of principles and character.  The final two volumes cover recording unsuitable calls and ancient worthies, recorded saying of some disciplines and concerning the right government. In summary, this text would be of interest to anyone seeking knowledge about the sayings and philosophy of Confucius. Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Haiku Moments: How to read, write and enjoy Haiku)

He's a go-to for psuedo-intellectuals, wannabe philosophers, and internet egotists. But all the pretentious stigma aside, the Analects is a worthy read. If you're here to deconstruct morality, you're reading the wrong book. Confucius was a man of objectivity, and often refers to "the superior man" as one who upholds virtuous ideals, exercises discipline, and offers unwavering, indiscriminate compassion and respect for his fellowman. That said, his "teachings" read like a motivational book; His verses on conduct and behavior are humbling, and can contribute much to the one seeking self-improvement.

I have enjoyed reading this book and learned from it.  My question is:  Who wrote all of the sayings down and then saved them?  OK, I looked my questions up and found that the Author was the Disciples of Confucius, and they wrote this in the 4th century BC, and was kept in a book called The Analects of Confucius.  Google has more answers.  :-) Enjoy

However, it is worth serious study. I reject but many admire.  To study you need a very good edition. This is it. Brief, blunt, readily understandable. Much of the Master's work is fragmentary, much is cut off. That is reality. Everyone should study the works of Master Kong, however, as the story of Chinese culture if fascinating and, itself, enlightening. Master Kong still controls much of the thinking of the present Communist Party of China. Decide for yourself about the merits of the philosophical teaching, but this is an excellent book for study. Repeat: much of the work is fragmentary.

4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Mary Soon Lee	4.0	2018年1月17日 在美国审核	0	I found the central ideas very appealing.	The Analects consists of passages compiled by the followers of Confucius, containing many quotes attributed to Confucius, together with comments from others about Confucius, quotes from his disciples, etc. Not being well-informed about China circa 500 BC, I found D. C. Lau's accompanying introduction, appendices, and notes very helpful in understanding the main text. The Analects are rather disjointed, with no overarching organizational thread running through the passages. They are also rather dry. They lack the poetic quality of, say, the Bhagavad Gita or the King James Bible (at least in this translation). But I found the central ideas in the Analects very appealing, and therefore liked the book considerably. Confucius thought that one should behave morally not in the hope of reward either in this life or any afterlife, but because it is the right thing to do. He prized learning, being benevolent, being trustworthy in what one says. For instance, the following quote by Confucius appears three times: "Make it your guiding principle to do your best for others and to be trustworthy in what you say." I also appreciate the sentiment that correct behavior changes over time, which allows me to hope that had Confucius lived in modern times he would have had a more favorable attitude toward women, who are barely mentioned in the Analects. Three more quotes of Confucius's that I liked: - "When you make a mistake, do not be afraid of mending your ways." - "It is not the failure of others to appreciate your abilities that should trouble you, but rather your failure to appreciate theirs." - "If a man remembers what is right at the sight of profit, is ready to lay down his life in the face of danger, and does not forget sentiments he has repeated all his life even when he has been in straitened circumstances for a long time, he may said to be a complete man."
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	laurens van den muyzenberg	5.0	2013年1月24日 在美国审核	0	Getting to know Confucius (551-479 BC) is very worthwhile	The Analects contain twelve books (I to XX) each with around 15 to 50 numbered paragraphs. Confucius believed a leader that acted virtuously without resort to punishment could govern a country. Confucius lived in the "hundred philosophers period "551-233 BC. Two other prominent philosophers in that period were Mo Tzu with Consequentialism (see my review) and Han Fei Tzu with Legalism (see my review).  Many of Confucius ideas are similar to Mo Tzu, be it with some important differences (see later). The government never practiced Confucius ideas without including some of the ideas of Legalism, which emphasized the establishment of laws and punishment.  I have read the analects several times and analyzed each paragraph for relevance and usefulness to day. Many are. I learned a lot.  Many authors have tried to group these paragraphs under a few headings, some under the Chinese words, Jen, Chun tzu, Li, Te and Wen. The author presents in the Introduction such a summary of 46 pages of the  Analects text 102 pages.  My recommendation is to read the analects before the introduction and determine what you think is relevant to day.  Confucius presents ideas on how you should think and act. I  have selected a few of the paragraphs about government and the way to act that I hope  will encourage you to read the analects.  XII.19.Question. What would you think if I were to kill those who do not follow the way (do what is right)? Answer, What need is there for you to kill? Just desire the good yourself and the common people will be good. The virtue of the gentleman is like wind; the virtue of the small man is like grass. Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend.  II.3 Guide them with edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. Guide them with virtue, keep them in line with rites, and they will, besides having a sense of shame, reform themselves  XVI.10 There are nine things the Gentleman turns his thought to: seeing clearly when he uses his eyes, to hearing acutely, when he uses his ears, to looking cordial when it comes to his countenance, to appearing respectful when it comes to his demeanor, to being conscientious when he speaks, to be reverent when he performs his duties, to seeking advice when he is in doubt, (be aware) of the consequences when he is enraged, and to do what is right at the sight of gain.   IV.15 The way of the master consists in doing one's best and in using oneself as a measure to gauge others.  VI.3 Yen Hui was eager to learn. Unfortunately his allotted span was a short one and he died". Mo Tzu concluded from this last paragraph that Confucius was a fatalist  All three philosophers believed that the ancestors were living in heaven and watching their descendants and interfering in what happened on earth. Elaborate funerals were held to show respect. Confucius supported rites and elaborate funerals. Mo Tzu said," if the officials sincerely desire to practice benevolence and righteousness and to benefit the people of China, they ought to adapt moderation in funerals as a principle of government.  The paragraphs also show that Confucius believed that it was possible for leaders to govern by acting virtuously and skeptical about the use of laws and punishment as advocated by Han Fei Tzu (II.3).

Indeed, Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas. So with China on the rise, what better ideas to look at than Confucius’, who lived over 2,500 years ago. His sayings are in this book, “Analects”, which are said to have been recorded by his disciples. What I've found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures, which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments. So I've picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary: Basics of working: An overarching principle to work by is "do not impose on others what you yourself do not want" Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid over-promising and under-delivering Money and status: Money and status are what everyone wants, but unless you get them in the right way don’t hold on to them It is easier to be arrogant when rich, then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant; the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Don’t worry if you don’t get the job title you want – worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job. Don’t worry that no one appreciates your abilities – try to earn their appreciation Don’t blame others for not seeing your talent, blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others: Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships, not factions/cliques To get staff to look up to you, promote the honest staff over the political ones People who are pleased with whatever the manager says is of no help to the manager A good manager helps others realise what is good in them, the bad manager helps them realise what is bad in them Leadership: Leadership is to know when you know, and say you don’t when you don’t Five things will make a leader great: respectfulness, tolerance, trustworthiness in words, delivering results quickly, and generosity Do not be impatient as you will not reach your goals. Do not be short-termist as you’ll not accomplish the big goals If leaders themselves didn’t act unethically, no-one would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly, others will follow them even without orders, but if they are not correct in their actions, others will not follow even if orders are given For more like this, see bilalhafeez.com

If you're looking for quotes about virtue (or really anything) read this and I'm sure you'll find something. I found it interesting that certain values that arose in other parts of the world also arose there in China, completely independent. An example would be found in Book 12:2: "Do not impose on others what you would not like for yourself." Very similar to the Christian 'Golden Rule.' Quite interesting. If you're at all interested in Chinese culture/history, this is a must read.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	James Yanni	3.0	2015年1月9日 在美国审核	0	Interesting in spots, tedious in others.	There were a fair number of sayings in this book that seemed pretty irrelevant or impenetrable to the modern reader, mostly dealing with references to famous leaders of the past who would have been familiar to Confucious and his target audience, but who most modern westerners will have never heard of. Also, some of the phrasing is more than a touch convoluted. But there are a surprising number of the sayings that were perfectly clear, and perfectly relevant, even halfway around the world, millennia later, including a version of the Golden Rule. ("What I do not wish others to do to me, that also I wish not to do to them." Chapter 11, Book 5) I'm not certain how many of my complaints are due to the actual text, and how many are due to having a cheap translation with few notes.

Lau	Taylor Ellwood	4.0	2009年1月18日 在美国审核	0	An intriguing read	I found this to be a fascinating book because it presents a perspective on social morality and the obligations constructed around having a family and a duty to the society you live in. I'm not sure if the translation is as accurate as it could be and there were times where the subtlety of the subject matter escaped me, likely because I'm not from china nor do I really have an accurate understanding of the culture in Confucius's time, let alone present time. Still, I found this book fascinating because it presents a different perspective on social responsibility and morality toward the people we interact with. I highly recommend reading it as an opportunity to expand your horizons both culturally and for social responsibility.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Brett	4.0	2002年7月11日 在美国审核	12	Surprisingly Relevent	I was surprised to find that I was often very interested in the topics within this book and Confucius' handling of said themes. Having read Plato only a short time ago, Confucius seemed like a breath of fresh air. His concerns are how to live a virtuous life and achieve benevolence. Unlike much ancient philosphy, many of the sayings have their impact undimished by time. In each book (consisting usually of about 3 pages) there would generally be at least two or three sayings that struck me as truly meaningful and pertinent. Naturally, there were also some that seemed out of place or irrational, but that is to be expected in any text which is so old. If one is able to mine the gold from the rocks, Analects of Confucius can be quite a rewarding experience. However, I found the introduction and essays in the back of the book to be superfluous and felt that they did not shed much additional light on who Confucius was or what his teachings meant, choosing instead to focus mostly on minutue that was mostly uninteresting to me. This book is not a long read, and almost certainly worth a curious person's time.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Randall	5.0	2014年7月5日 在美国审核	3	A little gem of a book	The Analects of Confucius is one of the most influential books ever written anywhere. Although I cannot read the original Chinese, this remarkably lucid translation makes me feel quite close to the source. The translation makes a point of allowing some of the dazzling fragments in the Analects to remain just that without trying to smooth them out artificially. This is important as it allows the modern reader to appreciate the complex texture of an ancient text on its own terms. Both the introduction and the endnotes are quite helpful in elucidating some of the difficulties and the ambiguities in the text encountered by the general reader. Additionally, the size of the book is perfect. It is small enough to carry anywhere. Overall, highly recommended!
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	David Marshall	4.0	2000年11月23日 在美国审核	12	The brilliance of humility.	If, when you think of "eastern philosophy," yourheart goes pitter-patter for esoteric revelations from AscendedMasters, stories of Jesus practicing magic in Tibet as a youngster, oreven the mind-expanding wit of Zhuang Zi, you may find Confuciusboringly prosaic.  His wisdom lies in a different direction, and ismore subtle.  The Analects is like a bowl of Chinese dumplings, or attheir most flavorful dim sum, that you pick out one at a time andlearn the taste and value of.  Few of his sayings are brilliant, butrather the kind of mundane and kindly profundity that the war-wearyChina of the late Zhou found so filling.  In modern China, too, I havefound that Confucius is very popular, probably more popular than thewitty Lao Zi. Confucius said his teachings were connected by asingle thread.  While a disciple gave a slightly different solution,the thread I suggest you follow through this otherwise ratherdisjointed collection of teachings and observations is humility.  Bythat I don't mean self-abnegation or loss of individuality in thecollective, but an ability to see clearly in all directions -- above,towards superiors (ultimately God), below, compassion for the needy,within, ("To know what you know, and know what you don't know,this is knowledge") and without, to take an interest in the worldaround you.  (Confucius became China's "first teacher"because he himself was "eager to learn.") To me, this kindof integrated humility is the starting point for any worthwhilephilosophy of life. The Analects can also be of value to peopleinterested in the critical study of the New Testament, by the way.This book greatly resembles the Gospels in terms of genre.  Bothconsist of sayings and actions of a teacher who traveled with a bandof disciples, as recorded by the early community of followers.  Fewscholars doubt the historical character of the Analects, whilecontroversy about the Gospels makes headlines on a regular basis.  Itis interesting to me that the same internal arguments scholars likeCreel and Lau use to prove the Analects, apply even more strongly tothe Gospels.  If you do read the two sets of documents together, youmight try the further experiment of comparing Confucius' ideal person,sage or "Savior" as Confucian scholar Chen Jingpan describeshim, to the central character of the Gospels.  Remember that Menciussaid a sage would appear once every 500 years, and Confucius lived in500 B.C. As a Christian I respect Confucius not only as a great moralteacher, but also sometimes think he might have been a kind ofprophet. Five stars for Confucius; one lost in translation.Soothill seems accurate, as far as I can tell, and the price is right,but his language is a bit archaic at times.

The thing about it, is that I read it cover to cover.  Clearly, this deep and old wisdom is best taken in small bits for not many words are wasted.  Also, the Lionel Giles translation I read was weak on supplemental commentary so I really felt like I needed a more knowledgeable guide as I was reading.  Perhaps the Norton version would have better annotations then the beautiful Easton Press version from my library.  It is clearly a five star book, but I think I only got about three stars out of it.  Most certainly a book to read again, and again and again.

Lau	Tomas Cvrcek	5.0	2006年3月9日 在美国审核	18	I, for one, liked the introductory comments	I guess, there is not much point in buying this book for the text of Lunyu itself: it is available in full on the Internet (for example at Wengu: [...] - in the Chinese original, two English - including Lau's - and one French translation) but it is the introduction and adjoining commentaries that are of value. In this respect, I found D.C.Lau's work quite pleasing. He explains the main terms and how they hang together, illustrates his arguments with quotations from the actual Analects and tries his best to relate Confucius' philosophy to suitable analogues in the Western tradition. I am no China-expert, so this helped a lot. The book also has a post-script outlining Kong-zi's life and a short piece on the individual disciples and friends that Confucius converses with in the book. I think there is $9 of value (or whatever the price) in this book.

Nothing at all is said about any sort of internal transformation  as one finds in Lao-Tze. I can't read Chinese, so I can't say how accurate  the translation is, but if this is what Confucius was all about I just  don't see what all the fuss is about.

Better translations have been made, in my opinion. However, the prose itself is well-styled and clearly separated. Concise and easy to understand. The fluency of the book is what seems most troubling.

Confucius is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest thinkers ever and his analacts, a collection of his thoughts and teachings are right up there with Sun Tzu's Art of War for the respect they still recieve today. Conficius has many great teachings in this very short book, I trawled through it with a highlighter and regularly go back and reread the lines which mean the most to me. Some of his ideas can change the way you think and act towards others for the better if you take them onboard and apply them in your life. This book would also be good for anyone who appreciates inspiration books like Art of War for application in management situations. The ideas may be able to help you better understand, communicate with and respect colleagues.
4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Abhishek Debnath	5.0	2018年9月18日 在印度审核	7	"Chinese Bible"	The book is considered as the Chinese Bible throughout the ages and widely read. Confucianism, as an orthodox philosophy, is based on The Analects. The book is a collection of Confucius's wisdom compiled together by his disciples. These teachings are still relevant as self-knowledge and pursuit of virtue are ageless themes. Now about the quality of the book. This book is awfully produced to say the least. This is a Penguin Classics edition and they just failed themselves to do justice to their fame. From the font selection to the quality of pages, everywhere a careless attitude is prevailing. The translation is up to the mark but the book has missed it.

4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	laurens van den muyzenberg	5.0	2013年1月24日 在英国审核	4	Getting to know Confucius (551-479 BC) is very worthwhile	The Analects contain twelve books (I to XX) each with around 15 to 50 numbered paragraphs. Confucius believed a leader that acted virtuously without resort to punishment could govern a country. Confucius lived in the "hundred philosophers period "551-233 BC. Two other prominent philosophers in that period were Mo Tzu with Consequentialism (see my review) and Han Fei Tzu with Legalism (see my review).  Many of Confucius ideas are similar to Mo Tzu, be it with some important differences (see later). The government never practiced Confucius ideas without including some of the ideas of Legalism, which emphasized the establishment of laws and punishment.  I have read the analects several times and analyzed each paragraph for relevance and usefulness to day. Many are. I learned a lot.  Many authors have tried to group these paragraphs under a few headings, some under the Chinese words, Jen, Chun tzu, Li, Te and Wen. The author presents in the Introduction such a summary of 46 pages of the  Analects text 102 pages.  My recommendation is to read the analects before the introduction and determine what you think is relevant to day.  Confucius presents ideas on how you should think and act. I  have selected a few of the paragraphs about government and the way to act that I hope  will encourage you to read the analects.  XII.19.Question. What would you think if I were to kill those who do not follow the way (do what is right)? Answer, What need is there for you to kill? Just desire the good yourself and the common people will be good. The virtue of the gentleman is like wind; the virtue of the small man is like grass. Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend.  II.3 Guide them with edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. Guide them with virtue, keep them in line with rites, and they will, besides having a sense of shame, reform themselves  XVI.10 There are nine things the Gentleman turns his thought to: seeing clearly when he uses his eyes, to hearing acutely, when he uses his ears, to looking cordial when it comes to his countenance, to appearing respectful when it comes to his demeanor, to being conscientious when he speaks, to be reverent when he performs his duties, to seeking advice when he is in doubt, (be aware) of the consequences when he is enraged, and to do what is right at the sight of gain.   IV.15 The way of the master consists in doing one's best and in using oneself as a measure to gauge others.  VI.3 Yen Hui was eager to learn. Unfortunately his allotted span was a short one and he died". Mo Tzu concluded from this last paragraph that Confucius was a fatalist  All three philosophers believed that the ancestors were living in heaven and watching their descendants and interfering in what happened on earth. Elaborate funerals were held to show respect. Confucius supported rites and elaborate funerals. Mo Tzu said," if the officials sincerely desire to practice benevolence and righteousness and to benefit the people of China, they ought to adapt moderation in funerals as a principle of government.  The paragraphs also show that Confucius believed that it was possible for leaders to govern by acting virtuously and skeptical about the use of laws and punishment as advocated by Han Fei Tzu (II.3).

4	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	D. C. Lau	Jonathan R	4.0	2013年1月9日 在英国审核	2	Timeless wisdom, with solid editing	I understand that this is no fault of the writer(s); Confucius has much less surviving work than western counterparts Plato, Aristotle etc. - and it can be a little offsetting.  This book won't read like Plato's "Republic", Aristotle's 'Politics' or pretty much anything else - it's more of a compilation of the sayings of Confucius (hence 'Analects').  Some excerpts are a single line, whilst others a whole page.  This makes for very easy picking up, as you won't need to remember where you left off, really. What I can make of this book is that Confucius was an extremely wise man, and it's a shame that he didn't write his own book(s).  Also, there are great footnotes in this version of The Analects, and extensive further reading material at the back of the book; in addition to a very scene setting introduction. It'll be a quick read (therefore buy it from a cheaper supplier), but unquestionably worthwhile

Lau	minimaldrobe	5.0	2009年12月14日 在英国审核	20	Words of wisdom- can be a constant companion	I purchased this having often enjoyed reading asserted Confucius quotes on sites such as wikiquote, and others. When I discovered I could purchase them in this form, I ordered it. About half a year later I started to read it, having purchased many classics at once. I am not a stranger to reading philosophy: odd, perhaps, considering my age (19). I had read Nietzsche, Milton Friedman's monograph Capitalism and Freedom, much of Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own, numerous political essays and opinion pieces, Machiavelli's The Prince...all those were much more 'cynical' than Confucius, who has a wonderful, if cautious outlook on life. Nietzsche, too, has this property, although it takes a reader to understand the underlying celebration, and to reach the joyful regions of his arguments. Confucius, known here generally as 'The Master', can be summed simply: he promotes 'wisdom' and 'benevolence' as the chief sources of happiness in life. To Confucius, what follows this is loyalty, social cohesion (if we strive for benevolence, then we are bound to please others, and thus have them seek to please us). In other words, Confucius believes that these elements help the reproduction of society, and the reproduction of man. Confucius refreshingly believes that men can improve themselves, and can become Gentlemen whether they are poor, or are rich. Becoming a gentle man (to twist the translation to show its etymological implications) is, therefore, a wonderful cause, and something which is rewarding. The early chapters are less interesting than the later, but I picked up and read this over a long period of time (a large break), so I may be wrong. I would read a chapter or a half every day or two, and would on the rest of my journey throughout the hours muse on them, internalise them, think on their wisdom. The less helpful passages are ones which are not as applicable to a secular, Western reader, such as about ancestor worship, and perhaps too the rigorousness of 'filial piety': obeying of one's parents, and the writings based around tea and rice (although we can substitute this and simply take the wisdom behind it). However, the principles Confucius founds these ideas on are sound and are rigorously applied: for example, Confucius writes that "If a man sets his heart on benevolence, he will be free from evil"- the same is true of Kings, Dukes, Lords, all of whom should lead by example- Confucius believed, having served in government himself in his younger years, that if their leaders were good and kind, so too would be their people. D.C. Lau's edition is thoughtful, and its footnotes are often helpful, particularly on corruption. Something I did not note until I was near the end of the book was the very helpful glossary of names after the main text, which I would recommend to use- The Analects were written down by Confucius' followers and friends, thus the majority of the sayings are based around dialogue between those individuals and The Master. Confucius' humility, wisdom and sticking to his principles are refreshing. Most importantly to this review, this book helped stabilise me at a time when I was uncertain and thinking a lot- Nietzsche may have turned me into a man of dynamite ("I am not a man, I am Dynamite", Ecce Homo), I feel Confucius helped turn me into a wiser man. Lightweight and easy to pick up, I'd recommend The Analects to anyone who perhaps wants to immerse themselves in one of the significant roots of China's culture, and to immerse themselves in their own mind and thoughts. Often the most favourable interpretation of a saying is best- be open and respectful (to be Confucian) and these sayings will help you as they certainly did with me. I only wish I had the volume here at university, something I will rectify when I return home. 5 stars/5

Lau	Chunky Monkey	5.0	2009年6月11日 在英国审核	51	Great resource & easy reference	Other than in passing reference I am new to Confucius' body of work and The Analects have been an excellent place to start.  D. C. Lau's introduction lays excellent ground for the reader to understand and put into context The Analects.  It is this introduction that makes this translation stand out from others I perused before purchasing. Having read through once I now use this book daily as a reference of useful and practical principles.  Much of the guidance given by Confucius is as relevant today as it was over 2500 years ago.  In the spirit of Confucius, I would recommend you apply his teachings as part of your own personal quest to self discovery to improve the world around you. Ahead of his time, it is disappointing that Confucius and The Analects are not more common in education syllabuses to encourage young people to consider their environment, politics and relationships with other human beings.  In a society where ego is usually a guiding principle of success, I highly recommend The Analects as your own personal `check and balance'. I haven't changed the world and I've certainly not lost my ego, but the teachings of Confucius (in this publication) have helped me temper my arrogance and consider my relationships with friends relatives and colleagues; all for the better.

The text is corrupt in many parts and that is acknowledged by the writer. It has more to do with the life, times, culture of eastern philosophy than wisdom. Emperors, lords, masters, servants.  It is okay as a book but you get the feeling that a completely new and revised copy needs to be produced. And where passages are inscrutable, they should not be included as interpenetrating them would be a guess. This book should be brought back to the drawing board, but has merit as a good work of philosophy and summary of eastern culture.

Indeed, Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas. So with China on the rise, what better ideas to look at than Confucius’, who lived over 2,500 years ago. His sayings are in this book, “Analects”, which are said to have been recorded by his disciples. What I've found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures, which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments. So I've picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary: Basics of working: An overarching principle to work by is "do not impose on others what you yourself do not want" Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid over-promising and under-delivering Money and status: Money and status are what everyone wants, but unless you get them in the right way don’t hold on to them It is easier to be arrogant when rich, then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant; the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Don’t worry if you don’t get the job title you want – worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job. Don’t worry that no one appreciates your abilities – try to earn their appreciation Don’t blame others for not seeing your talent, blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others: Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships, not factions/cliques To get staff to look up to you, promote the honest staff over the political ones People who are pleased with whatever the manager says is of no help to the manager A good manager helps others realise what is good in them, the bad manager helps them realise what is bad in them Leadership: Leadership is to know when you know, and say you don’t when you don’t Five things will make a leader great: respectfulness, tolerance, trustworthiness in words, delivering results quickly, and generosity Do not be impatient as you will not reach your goals. Do not be short-termist as you’ll not accomplish the big goals If leaders themselves didn’t act unethically, no-one would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly, others will follow them even without orders, but if they are not correct in their actions, others will not follow even if orders are given For more like this, see bilalhafeez.com

This version was translated by a Chinese-American scholar who had moved to the US when she was 12 so the English was perfect and easy to read. She had a lot of added commentary which gave you a very complete and understandable look at the times Confucius lived in. She used other Chinese commentators on his work to add to the reader's understanding. He lived in turbulent time and I found his advice and admonitions to be relevant even to a 21st Century American.

5	论语	The Analects	孔子弟子	Annping Chin	Adrian J. Smith	4.0	2016年10月5日 在英国审核	7	An excellent translation and analysis	The Analects is the primary work within the Confucian canon, but by no means an easy read. The format of the book is a compilation of sayings attributed to Confucius, followed by analysis by the book’s translator Chin Anping.  A clear strength is the updated translation, using the standard Pin Yin as opposed to the phonetically misleading Wade-Giles system, coupled with a more updated and correct understanding of the proverbs and sayings.  The work’s primary focus is upon moral character, stressing the need to be humane, the character of a gentleman, and how a just ruler should behave. For the latter, there is surprisingly fewer analects than one would expect, which may leave those wanting a more clear understanding of the Chinese mindset on governance wanting for more.  It is worth noting that the Analects is the first work in the Confucian canon, which was greatly expanding by followers such as Mencius and Xunzi.  Not an easy read, but an essential one for understanding Chinese views on morals and principles.

There are many versions of this deeply important work, but this translation by Annping Chin is the best of them all. Why? Because it is complete, one cannot understand the passages without commentary providing the context, and Annping Chin is one of the leading experts on the life of Confucius in the West, her translation and annotations bring the sentiments of the great philosopher-practitioner and his students to life. Secondly, this work features both the English translation and the original Chinese text for cross-reference. Confucianism is a philosophy that has many interpretations, it has survived for thousands of years and has a long way to go, this is the first choice text for understanding and important aspect of Chinese culture and receiving guidance for your own life.

6	三国演义	Romance of the Three Kingdoms Volume 1	罗贯中	C. H. Brewitt-Taylor	Mary Soon Lee	3.0	2019年4月19日 在美国审核	7	The book is a classic of Chinese literature, but I prefer the translation by Moss Roberts.	This is the first half of C. H. Brewitt-Taylor's translation of the 14th-century Chinese classic. I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Roberts's translation. While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions, as a reader I considerably prefer Roberts's translation, primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes. Lacking the information in those endnotes, I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative. The one respect in which I prefer the Brewitt-Taylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another. He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does, which may appeal to some readers (though not me) as suggesting the story's venerable age. The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago, and is based on historical events from about 200 A.D. I note that I am finding it helpful to read each chapter twice, once in each translation. The book has a vast cast of characters, none of whom I was familiar with before, but many of whom would have been known to its original audience. Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasn't trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported. (Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names.) I will postpone comment on the book's quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end. P.S. My rating of 3 out of 5 stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story, and I may well end up giving the Roberts's translation a higher rating.
6	三国演义	Romance of the Three Kingdoms Volume 1	罗贯中	C. H. Brewitt-Taylor	Robert E. Maxwell	2.0	2012年5月13日 在美国审核	45	Was there an editor?	This review doesn't really concern the story - Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature, and it'd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review. It's amazing, and exciting, and definitely read it if you can. What I will review - and what I have significant problems with - is the Tuttle edition for Kindle. I can't really speak on the printed edition, but a lot of my criticisms, I suspect, will apply. Firstly, there are a ton of typos. I'm averaging one per page now. Things like: "Today her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends/ and her influence is enormous." It seems petty, and normally I'd ignore it, but it gets on your nerves after a while. The fact that there are so many of these errors speaks to a lack of proper editing, I think, which leads to my next point: a lot of the prose is pretty bad, stylistically. It varies from place to place, but it's at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment. More than once I've had to stop and ask myself: "who is the subject of this sentence?" or even "who is the direct object?" which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about. The register of the translation changes as well - one second a character might be speaking in a very formal, periphrastic "bureaucratese" and then end the sentence with something jarringly vernacular. It seems like a minor issue, but things like that can confuse characterization and are just generally poor usage. More generally, the dialogue is stilted and artificial: "The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien Shih." Stylistically, it's an awkward sentence - why phrase it like that? It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker - which is fine, as long as there's a strong editor to clean things up, which seems to be lacking here. The next one is a bit of a preference thing, I'll admit: usage of Wade-Giles. When I was learning Chinese, Pinyin was the ONLY romanization used. Say what you want about the merits of Wade-Giles, but Pinyin is what people are going to generally be familiar with today. So when I read through this and see (I think) Kongsun Tsan, I have to stop and translate it in my head: "Kongsun Tsan? Is that Gongsun Zan?" (I've read this book - different editions - a number of times, so I'm familiar with the characters. Otherwise I'd honestly be lost.) Now I hear what you're saying: "but what about the people that don't know anything about China? Wade-Giles would be so much simpler. That way people aren't pronouncing Cao as Cow!" There are a number of other issues in the book that make that a questionable argument. Firstly, WG has its issues here as well - Kongsun's "Kong" is not pronounced as in King Kong. There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes, once more to do with consnant voicing, but someone utterly unfamiliar with Chinese would be tripped up by it just as well as they would with Pinyin's c equalling (roughly) [ts]. But this is a huge digression. For the uninitiated there are somewhat larger issues. Most notably, the usage of ranks. The book is a bit ambivalent about this: when we first meet Guangong, the book notes that this signifies he is Lord Guan (as gong = lord). Other times, however, the book introduces ranks (Chinese ranks) without a single explanation of what it is: "so-and-so was at the time occupying the rank of ssu-tu." Well, ok - what is this rank? Where is it on the hierarchy? Is it low or high? For the record, ssu-tu is situ or "Minister of Education." It's worth noting that the edition didn't even get this right: ssu-tu would be si-du in Pinyin, as tu=du and t'u=tu. If you care, the apostrophe (as far as I know) here represents differentiation in consnant voicing. Why was it necessary to tell us this character was "ssu-tu" without explaining WHAT it was? (The Minister of Education, an important post, which would help explain why this person was in a position to plan a coup.) The book does this a number of times, which makes the sections revolving around court intrigue especially painful, as we're told person x had position a, person y had position b and person x had position c, with the positions generally not elaborated upon. The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesn't: "Commissioner X told Y Ssu-tu [note the Chinese syntax for titles] such-and-such." Some titles are fully translated and some aren't - so we're hearing Empress Ling tell Tung T'ai-hou (=Dowager Empress) something. It then switches. Overall, INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court. So we have a confused usage of ranks (some English, some Chinese, some mixed) which at times have no explanation as to what they are or where they are in the court hierarchy. At best, we've been briefed once, and it's NEVER touched again. Why couldn't the translator simply render "ssu-tu" as Minister of Education throughout the book? What would it have taken away that was more important than clarity?

6	三国演义	Romance of the Three Kingdoms Volume 1	罗贯中	C. H. Brewitt-Taylor	Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	5.0	2018年6月24日 在美国审核	0	Inspiring and spiritual	This book is enormous. Two volumes with around 1,400 pages. It is a long saga, an epic some say, in a way a picaresque epic across the whole of China during the Han dynasty of the empire, when that empire was at risk because of internal strife and the incapability of the emperor to keep things under control, by his own fault (the own fault of several emperors one after another) and inability of building some kind of government that could be reliable, transparent and non-corrupted. And that is where the book is amazingly revealing. This empire is quite obviously a feudal empire. Power is in the hands of governors appointed by the emperor in each district. The governors are appointed for what these people did for the empire, particularly what they did militarily, and there the difference between serving the empire and serving themselves is not always clear. Ambitious people can climb to the top in no time and then impose their power. The decomposition of this empire started when the various feudal lords or lordlings started considering the eunuchs, organized in a very close community and clan, who were provided by the emperor with the full control of the government because the emperor is lazy in many ways and looks for an easy way to control such a big empire, and because the emperor is incompetent technically (ignorance of a lot of things necessary for government) and psychologically (unfit to exercise such an enormous power). He then relied on the eunuchs of the empire, a clan of men – and their relatives – who had been castrated for any reason whatsoever, among others to become the top officers of the empire. The most famous eunuch along that line was Admiral Zheng He who had been castrated at an early age because he was a Muslim and he became the top man of the Chinese fleet before it was dismantled by the Confucian Mandarins when they took over around 1430. These corrupted eunuchs encourage all kinds of outlaws to go around in the country and raid cities and farming areas to their own profit and to the shared profit with local supporters of the eunuchs. A rebellion came from the various local or regional lords who had the power and the means to raise armies. They united and finally succeeded in getting all the eunuchs eliminated and executed, but the main military force was in the hands of an ally of the local and regional lords, an ex-outlaw who shifted from raiding cities and farming communities to raiding the central government by taking control of it. The empire is then at stake because it explodes into rivaling cities and provinces and the central brigand controlling the empire spreads and increases his power by taking control of rebellious provinces. This is typically feudal. Power is in the hands of the stronger person, of the stronger clan, and stronger means military force and nothing else. Then this power is only a way for those in power to loot the country by levying armed forces and taxes for their own profit. Then the emperor can even be chosen, within the Han line, but for how long? That’s the beginning of the saga but that explains the whole saga: feudalism was the real social and political architecture of the Chinese empire. The main originality is that there was no spiritual or religious authority of any sort that could set some criteria and norms for everyone and keep the whole empire unified by some kind of spiritual allegiance, unity. That’s the main difference with European feudalism that was entirely controlled and governed by the Catholic church, hence by the Pope and his bishops and cardinals. Nothing like that in the Chinese Empire. So no Peace of God, becoming then Peace of the King in the various kingdoms, a movement that outlawed the use of military force within the limits of each kingdom and also within the limits of Christendom. That explained in part the crusades that started in the 11th century but it also explained the Teutonic crusade against the non-Christian Slavonic people in Poland, Ukraine and what they called Lithuania. War was directed to outside areas, officially non-Christian and to be Christianized. That started quite early after the fall of the Roman Empire and later on the fall of Charlemagne’s empire who only fought against the various Asian tribes or military forces trying to penetrate Europe from the East and against the mostly Muslim Saracens trying to do the same from Spain. And the emergence of such a spiritual force took a lot of time. The book was written after the takeover of the empire by the Confucian Mandarins and we could wonder if it is not a reflection of this evolution in the 15th century that inspired the author to show how bad it could have been before when the empire’s unity was endangered by internal strife and its unity was rebuilt later on by the leaders of the three kingdoms. We have to think of the other great saga of Chinese literature, “Journey to the West” by Wu Cheng’en, a saga whose earliest extant copy is traced to 1592 and is the story of a Monkey that travels to the west to discover the famous Buddhist scriptures that found the Taoist approach of life that developed in China as the spiritual guideline of the empire and can be considered as the basis of the Confucian Mandarin takeover in the 15th century. That is rather amazing to see this empire evolving from a purely feudal state with a marginal Taoist presence seen more like some witchcraft than anything else, though they carry the Chinese medical tradition and the ethical code of Taoism, the Chinese version of Buddhism in the making. Their final victory will destroy the Chinese fleet, the most impressive one in the whole world at the time, vastly centered on the China seas and the entire Indian Ocean and that would have been  capable to defend the empire against the European invasion that was still to come when Admiral Zheng He died. The result was a total closing up of the empire onto itself, which enabled the Europeans to come and take control of the whole of the Indian Ocean and then of the China Seas. Closing up on itself made the Chinese Empire weak, particularly the tool of its power was destroyed: the various commercial routes known as the Silk Roads. You will find all that in these books and it will make clear that the present commercial policy of China to reopen and redevelop the various Silk Roads is the only way for China to develop and recapture its past greatness. Will this policy re-establish some feudal state? Hardly conceivable. Will it establish some hierarchical centralized and unified system in the whole country and beyond? That’s also a dubious unrealistic view. China has to open itself to the world but that will not lead to the looting the English, the French and later on the Japanese tried to impose to China, but it may turn Chinas as the beating heart of the global economy, or at least one of the beating hearts of the global world using its commercial power rather than military force. That should bring you to wondering if the use of military force is not a feudal way of looking at the world and trying to dominate it. You may come to wondering if president Trump’s approach of the world is not a feudal way of looking at the problem in total opposition to and contradiction with the Chinese commercial approach of president Xi. To conclude I will say that Chinese literature, old or more recent like Lao She’s books and plays, is always centered on this problematic of the whole world in development and the choice between three possibilities: 1- pure military force and a feudal system; 2- pure spiritual closing up onto themselves and their protected own resources: some Confucian hierarchical architecture; 3- a general commercial vision that brings economic development to the world: modern sharing resources via some global free but regulated marketplace. Just get into this saga and enjoy the action and the treacherous ways of most of these feudal lords. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU
6	三国演义	Romance of the Three Kingdoms Volume 1	罗贯中	C. H. Brewitt-Taylor	susumu-5	5.0	2005年6月27日 在美国审核	24	Confusing For Spelling and Comprehensive For Pronunciation Ideas	Romance of Three Kingdoms is a part of East Asian culture. It overtook the heart of both Chinese and Japanese as well as people in Southeastern Asia. In Japan even younger generation who rarely read literature enjoy the story in the form of either comic books or in popular PC games. In China many of the Chinese Opera plays come from the part of this story. Every Chinatown around the world has one or some Guandi(Kuan Ti) Temples such as those in Nagasaki, Kobe and Yokohama. The story is based on the history of ancient China around late 2nd century to late 3rd century when the Chinese continent was divided by three strong kingdoms, Wei(Gui in Japanese),Wu(GO in Japanese) and Shu(SHOKU in Japanese). Part of the popularity of three kingdoms in Japan must be credited for Eiji Yoshikawa, the author of Musashi, focusing more on the story of Liu Bei(Shu emperor),Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhuge Liang. Comic book adaptation by Mitsuteru Yokoyama who is best known by the author of Iron Man(Tetsujin)#28  paved the way for current three kingdom boom in Japanese pop culture in general. Liu Bei, an heir of Han Dynasty ruling clan, is a humane leader supported by Guan Yu, deft both in brain and might maybe eastern version of Knight, Zhang Fei,short tempered but really strong warrior, and Zhuge Liang the master of strategy. Rivaling Lie Bei is another giant Cao Cao outstanding ruler and historically known as one of the finest compilers of Sun Tzu's Art of War. Cao Cao courting the emperor Xian nearly took hold of the whole Chinese continent but was blocked by the allied forces of Wu and Shu in 208 as the dramas such as   depicted. Cao Cao is a bit demonized in this story but he is in fact one of the greatest rulers China ever had comparable to Napoleon. Lie Bei who has little power gradually gains by charming a lot of talented people by his couteousness yet with propaganda tactics to demonize Cao Cao.  Cao Cao soon recovered from the defeat of the Chibi battle and with the finest staff collected from the whole continent he sought to break the alliance of Shu and Wu. After the death of Cao Cao, Cao Pi took over and named himself the emperor of Weihan. But Weihan would eventually be overthrown by Sima clan who would subdue both Shu and Wu but Lie Bei, Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang are still loved and idealized by Chinese public. On first reading you will be enjoying the way the characters outsmart the other camps. On second reading you will be struck by the humanity upon which the story is based. It is much more than a legend. It will surely get you closer to the mind of either Chinese and Japanese. But be careful. The way character name is pronounced differ between Chinese and Japanese. Such as Cao Cao is pronounced in Japanese as SOSO. ---------------- Now I must add a few things for newer 3k fans who encountered this epic through koei games. Koei adopts Pinyin system for three kingdom character names and pinyin method has almost subdued English speaking community. Brewitt Taylor uses Wade system differing so much from the way the character names were currently spelled. For example. Cao Cao is spelled T'sao T'sao. As you can see older system is useful in pronunciation ideas. Verdict: Excellent translation getting you much closer to this Chinese epic. Must-read for chivalry novel fans. Rating: 94 out of 100. A bit cut by spelling confusion as I mentioned. Recommended for the fans of Sun Tzu's Art of War, Chinese dramas or action and war fictions.

Snyder	3.0	2012年9月30日 在美国审核	7	OK translation, Kindle edition not so well made	This is an older translation; sometimes it opts for pseudo-medieval vocabulary, and as many others have noted, it uses the Wade-Giles system of romanizing the Chinese names rather than the pinyin one more often used these days. The newer translation by Moss Roberts probably reads better and has more apparatus, but is not available as an ebook. This ebook does allow one to read the Romance in English on your favorite Kindle platform, but the ebook, like so many of them, is quite badly made. It seems to have been scanned and run through an OCR program but not proofread properly, so that (quite aside from the Chinese names) English words come out misspelled on a regular basis. You can almost always emend the garbled reading, but it's a bit embarrassing for a once respectable publisher like Tuttle.

Volume one was less problematic than volume two, but both had a high number of instances.  The main problem is that letters that are similar in shape, such as b and d, p and g, etc. get switched, almost once a page.  Also, the names weren't proofread very well, as apostrophes get pretty regularly left out.  In a translation system where an apostrophe is the only difference between the names to two characters or places, this becomes a source of confusion.  Also, entire words are left out pretty regularly.  I wonder if any highly fluent English speakers actually got to proofread this, because most of these errors are so obvious.  These errors aren't so bad that it is unreadable, but they really take a person out of the scene while the confusion is dispelled.

Brewitt-Taylor	Andrew Fellows	5.0	2004年4月27日 在美国审核	7	One of the Best	This is a very good bok, filled with brotherhood, strategy, battles, loyalty, chivalry, etc. And although quite long,it is still worth it. It is a cultural classic, just like the Iliad and the Odyssey are to Greek culture.  It has many misspellings but they are easily surmounted and pose no real threat to the stories comprehension. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading, especially those who enjoy historical,cultural, or classical books.  Note: This translation may be somewhat confusing to some people because it uses the more old-fashioned Wade-Giles spellings rather than the more contemporary Pinyin System.  If you were introduced to the Three Kingdoms through the multiple video games that are out,as I was, that use the Pinyin system, it might take a little extra thought on your part to understand who is who as you are reading. For Example, Guan Yu and Cao Cao in Pinyin become Kuan Yü and Ts'ao Ts'ao in Wade-Giles.

However, having read Brewitt-Taylors masterful exposition, this translation seems lacking, in my opinion. First, I must confess, I hate the modern Pinyin system of romanization. I cannot abide in a system where letters do not have the proper values. I mean, an entire generation of Americans (and God help the ignorant French!) will pronounce names like Cao Cao as "Cow Cow", or the Qin dynasty as the "Kwin" dynasty. The Brewitt-Taylor translation uses the old Wade system, and while it can be hard on the eyes, the reader gets a sense of at least the rough pronunciation (Cao Cao is rendered Ts'ao Ts'ao, Qin is rendered Ch'in, etc). Also, Brewitt-Taylors translation is nice to listen to. "Empires wax and wane, states cleave asunder and coalesce"; the sound itself is beautiful, and yet still renders the sense clearly. The Roberts translation certainly succeeds in the latter, but the beauty is lost. However, Brewitt-Taylor requires a very great vocabulary, whereas Roberts is more tame in this regards. Still, this was a book for scholars, and the translation should at least reflect that. Again, if you have no familiarization with the events of this tale, the complete rainstorm of names is daunting indeed. Always keep in mind the three separate forces (Cao Cao of Wei, Liu Bei of Shu and the Sun family of Wu) as well as a few of the other players (Zhang Jiao of the Yellow Scarves, Dong Zhuo, Lu Bu, Yuan Shao. Liu Biao and Liu Zhang) and you'll do fine. The book itself, in my opinion, is the greatest book ever told, succeeding in being at once a work of strategy, psychology, government, warfare, and human emotion, and there is nothing like it in the lexicon of Western literature. Enjoy!

Unfortunately for this version, however, the story is not done much justice in its Pinyin translation. For newcomers to the series, it is quite difficult to become accustomed to it. I would recommend a Wade-Giles translation of this novel. On the plus side, this version is completely unabridged, so readers gain the full experience of one of China's great literary classics.

Volume 1 of 2 (I believe) and I was initially very confused about the pronounciations and spelling of the names of the characters before I realised I was thinking in a very 'Eurocentric' way, without taking into account the fact that the translations within are probably more accurate than those in the console games that have developed from these accounts. However, having worked my way through my confusion, this is an epic historical piece, rightly broken down as thew weight of the entirety would be too much to lift! The story of the fall of a Dynasty and the turmoil that followed very much engages, although I suppose you have to have a hiostorical turn of mind to get into it. Not just a list of times, people and events but a full narrative that tells of both the personal and political struggles that surfaced during the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

Perhaps I’m OCD, but I couldn’t get past the editing and returned this book the day I received it.

Grammar pains aside, I’m looking forward to reading this text. This review is more for whoever edited this book to improve coherence in future editions.

It is already interpreted for you, which can be helpful as a hand rail, but, without the original Chinese you lose all the sauce, what makes the text brilliant in the first place.

For accuracy, and keeping true to the source, this book is great and contains the original Chinese and how they translated it just in case you wish to interpret the language in your own ways for a deeper meaning in a sense because words in Chinese can often have many meanings and be interpreted in multiple ways. What I did not like in particular was the occasional suggestion cropping up throughout the pages that in order read some of the extra art of war material, one would have to buy several other books from the same author as it's not all contained within this book.

It's basically a hyper condensed cliffs notes version, and it seems to focus almost entirely on military conflict.  (yes I know, art of war, what did I expect?)  The Art of War is more than a military handbook, it encompasses the subject of "conflict" more than actual military war.  It was meant to be as useful to a mother trying to get her child to go to bed, as it is for a general about to engage in a troop movement.

This is an abbreviated, 60 page recap of some of the chapters takeaways. It’s my fault for not looking at how many pages the book was before ordering but it should clearly say in the title and description that this isn’t the complete book. Disappointed with misleading information.
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	Alex	1.0	2018年12月13日 在美国审核	40	62 Page “Pamphlet”.... NOT FULL TEXT	I was extremely disappointed after getting this book. I assumed it was the full length text (300+ pages) but what I received was a “pamphlet sized” text. You know what they say about assuming things, you can make an A$$ out of you and me..... well I did it to myself. To be fair.... the description DOES say 62 pages... I should have known better. None the less I put in a request to return this item as I have no need for 62 pages of bullet points... UPDATE: I received a full copy of the text and I went back to reference this text. ONLY A FEW CHAPTERS WE CLOSE TO SIMILAR... lots of different verbiage and it looks like the text was changed up to someone’s interpretation... DO NOT BUY IF YOU WNAT THE FULL TEXT!! Thank you :)
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	Cody Bachman	2.0	2020年5月6日 在美国审核	7	Not the full book!	While I am partially to blame for ignorantly forgetting to read reviews prior to purchasing this product, it is also deceiving. I always try to read reviews to ensure what I am buying is legitimate and a worthwhile purchase. This is not the full text of Art of War, and it is never stated as being anything less. Upon receiving it I was disappointed immediately when I saw the size. While I did read it in about 20 minutes, it was quite a disappointment compared to what I wanted. My advice is to research before buying, as there are many of this watered down style floating around in Amazon.
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	D. R. Knight	5.0	2019年6月29日 在美国审核	5	Life Lessons in a Nutshell	Yes, it's about war.  But Sun Tzu's strategies for war work amazingly well in business and any competitive endeavor.  I bought a copy of this book to pass along his wisdom to a new high school graduate.  The format of the books is highly accessible and an easy read.  I have other copies of the book with additional notations and explanations.  They're fine for background research, but I like this version for quick access to Sun Tzu's insights.

A quick read that supposedly teaches skills needed in management or on the battlefield. Know your enemy. Never completely surround your enemy. Treat your army as you would your children; show them love, yet do it with an iron fist. Pretty basic stuff on how to defeat obstacles in life.
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	JF	5.0	2016年6月19日 在美国审核	2	Great gift for an upcoming military leader	Purchased as a gift to one of my ROTC Cadets to begin their professional library. As part of a class assignment I asked each cadet what book would they no-kidding read, military or not, related to their academic major or not. After I compiled the list of books for the class I went online and ordered all the books from Amazon. I placed them at their seats prior to class and allowed them to enter the room w/o me being present for the first five minutes. It was, and still is, one of the good teaching moments of our time together. Thanks for helping me fulfill a need in their soon-to-be military career.

It is also very easy to see how the philosophy of Sun Tzu serves as inspiration for so many martial arts as well. I'm glad I finally got to read the whole thing.
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	Graham	5.0	2020年6月11日 在美国审核	0	Great read. A classic.	The book is as good as it has been for centuries, however, the narration was surprisingly bad.  The narrator misread many words throughout the book.  It was as if the narrator did not have adequate reading skills because they would say words completely different from what was printed.  This was confusing because the words the narrator said made no sense in the context of the sentence.  This made it so that i couldn't just listen to the book, i had to instead continually make sense of the narrator's mistakes.
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	Karsten	1.0	2018年4月9日 在美国审核	3	The "brochure" is a waste of money and time	The "brochure" is a waste of money and time. It's written entirely through numeric points that mostly make no sense. The sentences are written in very simple language, which could be either from the original author or a result of the translation. The described "tactics" are merely common sense, nothing surprising or extraordinary. The Art of War in this form of brochure serves at best to stabilize a wobbly table.

8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	Frederick Otero	5.0	2015年5月28日 在美国审核	0	The conduct of war.	The book is a classic and there very little to be said about this that has not been said by more experts on warfare then this reader. I recommend it to any person that is considering a career in the military. Volumes have been written on how to conduct military operations but in this case less is more, in this small book is a wealth of experience and knowledge that translates into the present state  of modern warfare. The shame is that many in the military that have read it can't seem to utilize the lessons to be learned that are clearly expressed in it.

There's no translator credited, or publisher outside of "Black and White Classics" printed inside of it, so citing this wouldn't have been fun. There's a small intro, and then the very basic translation. It actually came in handy when the other version of Art of War that i had got a little too verbose- I was able to refer to this one to get it "dumbed down a little", but I'm very glad I had the other copy to be able to quote, cite, and get more context for the class I am in.

8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	Christian	4.0	2018年3月20日 在美国审核	0	My Review of The Art of War by Sun Tzu	My mini-synopsis: This book is quite literally a guide filled with tips on how to go to war. It was written by Sun Tzu who was a Chinese general in the Eastern Zhou period. The book gives very specific actionable tips on how to be sure that your army will win a war. It has become very popular in the business world because many of the tips for war can be translated to be helpful in running a successful business. It is a very short read but is a great look into the mind of an extremely successful general, and gives great advice on how to build a successful “army”. Whether you are looking to win a war or win at business, Sun Tzu says, “Opportunities multiply as they are seized.” What I learned: I learned many tips on how win a battle using fire and spies but even more about how to run a business. The point that I found came up the most was to be unexpected. Never use the same strategy twice if you are trying to beat someone. In terms of how to handle competition, this is the best (least aggressive) strategy I found. Never do what people are expecting or you give them plenty of time to determine how they will defeat you. Additionally, a point that stood out to be was how tactics are like water. You can’t expect for a strategy that worked in one market to work just as well in another. Use it as a guide then be aware enough to allow the strategy to react to its surroundings, like water down a mountain. The final point I will make is a point that I have seen mentioned over and over in many books from most of the successful leaders (sans Jobs of course). Treat your people well! He specifically mentions that before “disciplining” them or pushing them too hard, they must fully trust you and be attached. Once again I am reminded that leaders lead by example which gives everyone the faith to trust them. Great quick read and now I feel like I need to go buy a samurai sword.
8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	BAP	5.0	2019年6月7日 在美国审核	0	All in all I would recommend this marvelous book to all Middle Schoolers to read.	For the past 2 months I have been reading this astounding book called The Art of War. The Art of War has been changing the world around us for more than 2,500 years. It was written by a war strategist, named Sun Tzu during his attempt to defend his country, Wu, from its larger neighbor, Chu. According to The Life Guides, a youtube channel. This remarkable book has inspired George Washington to find hope during the Revolutionary War, it has also helped The United States of America and many other countries to defend against the Nazis, and has inspired President Donald Trump’s business strategies. This book has also changed me in some vital ways. Here are a few of them. First, in karate, I am able to use my energy so much more effectively by applying some tips from the book. For example, the quotes “appear where you are least expected, “when the enemy is taking rest give him none“, “appear strong when you are weak”,  “ and avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak”. This book has also helped me in my day to day life. I have learned how to manage my time and to prioritize what I use it for. This helps me to prevent from getting overwhelmed with work. I would recommend this book to a person who is willing to change himself for the better, and who is willing to put in the effort to read it and understand it to its full extent. A couple of major questions raised by the book are: Did Sun Tzu ever even write the Art of War? Many historical facts suggest that Sun Tzu was not the original author; and Is The Art of War fiction, nonfiction, or realistic fiction? We will never know the book combines various genres and is subjective to the opinion of the reader. Sun Tzu spoke in complex and diverse riddles about war tactics, how to be a great leader, and more. His voice sounded wise but commanding and kept me hooked throughout the book. I wanted to keep reading the book, and this is coming from someone who despises reading in general.

8	孙子兵法	The Art of War	孙子	unknown	optionalgun	5.0	2018年10月8日 在英国审核	6	Interesting Read	I always wanted to give this book a go, with all the references to it in pop culture etc., and seeing as it's relatively cheap I just thought I would chuck it on to another order I was getting. First of all, the book was far smaller than I expected it to be. It's very slim, and the content on the pages is arranged into points with significant white space between each one. Maybe look up some images of the book to give yourself a better idea of what you're paying for. I personally find the points can be a little hard to digest, which is understandable given that it's translated from an older language/way of writing. Once you get past that though, it's a good and interesting read with many good points and I'm glad I purchased it.
